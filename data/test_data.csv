0705.2250,Topological Quiver Matrix Models and Quantum Foam,"  We study the matrix models that describe the BPS bound states of branes
arising from the quiver picture of the derived category. These theories have a
topological partition function that localizes to the Euler character of the
anti-ghost bundle over the classical BPS moduli space. We examine the effective
internal geometry of D6/D2 bound states in the local vertex geometry, using BPS
0-brane probes. The Kahler blowups of the Calabi-Yau that we find utilizing
these quiver theories are a realization of A-model quantum foam in the full IIA
theory.

0705.0682,Analytic models of plausible gravitational lens potentials,"  Gravitational lenses on galaxy scales are plausibly modelled as having
ellipsoidal symmetry and a universal dark matter density profile, with a Sersic
profile to describe the distribution of baryonic matter. Predicting all lensing
effects requires knowledge of the total lens potential: in this work we give
analytic forms for that of the above hybrid model. Emphasising that complex
lens potentials can be constructed from simpler components in linear
combination, we provide a recipe for attaining elliptical symmetry in either
projected mass or lens potential. We also provide analytic formulae for the
lens potentials of Sersic profiles for integer and half-integer index. We then
present formulae describing the gravitational lensing effects due to
smoothly-truncated universal density profiles in cold dark matter model. For
our isolated haloes the density profile falls off as radius to the minus fifth
or seventh power beyond the tidal radius, functional forms that allow all
orders of lens potential derivatives to be calculated analytically, while
ensuring a non-divergent total mass. We show how the observables predicted by
this profile differ from that of the original infinite-mass NFW profile.
Expressions for the gravitational flexion are highlighted. We show how
decreasing the tidal radius allows stripped haloes to be modelled, providing a
framework for a fuller investigation of dark matter substructure in galaxies
and clusters. Finally we remark on the need for finite mass halo profiles when
doing cosmological ray-tracing simulations, and the need for readily-calculable
higher order derivatives of the lens potential when studying catastrophes in
strong lenses.

0704.1732,"Spheroidal and torsional modes of quasistatic shear oscillations in the
  solid globe models of nuclear physics and pulsar astrophysics","  The past three decades of investigation on nuclear physics and pulsar
astrophysics have seen gradual recognition that elastodynamic approach to the
continuum mechanics of nuclear matter provides proper account of macroscopic
motions of degenerate Fermi-matter constituting interior of the nuclear
material objects, the densest of all known today. This paper focuses on one
theoretical issue of this development which is concerned with oscillatory
behavior of a viscoelastic solid globe in the regime of quasistatic,
force-free, non-compressional oscillations less investigated in the literature
compared to oscillations in the regime of standing shear waves. We show that in
this case the problem of computing frequency and lifetime of spheroidal and
torsional modes of non-radial shear vibrations damped by viscosity can be
unambiguously resolved by working from the energy balance equation and taking
advantage of the Rayleigh's variational method. The efficiency of this method
is demonstrated by solid globe models of nuclear physics and pulsar
astrophysics dealing with oscillations of a spherical mass of a viscoelastic
Fermi-solid with homogeneous and non-homogeneous profiles of the bulk density,
the shear modulus, and the shear viscosity.

of second order vector in differential geometry, emphasizing the existence of a

powerful framework of Dirichlet forms whose main feature is to apply easily to
infinite dimensional models including the Wiener space (giving an
interpretation of Malliavin calculus in terms of errors), the Poisson space and
the Monte Carlo space. In the fourth part we show how an error in the usual
mathematical sense, i.e. an approximate quantity, may yield a Dirichlet form
and we introduce the four bias operators. Eventually we connect the Dirichlet
form with statistics by identifying the square of field operator with the
inverse of the Fisher information matrix.

(HRMSMs), was recently introduced for longitudinal data for the purpose of
defining causal parameters which may often be better suited for public health
research or at least more practicable than MSMs \citejoffe,feldman. HRMSMs
allow investigators to analyze the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome
based on a fixed, shorter and user-specified history of exposure compared to
MSMs. By default, the latter represent the treatment causal effect of interest
based on a treatment history defined by the treatments assigned between the
study's start and outcome collection. We lay out in this article the formal
statistical framework behind HRMSMs. Beyond allowing a more flexible causal
analysis, HRMSMs improve computational tractability and mitigate statistical
power concerns when designing longitudinal studies. We also develop three

the Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighted (IPTW), G-computation and Double

0705.4156,Hidden Symmetry of the CKM and Neutrino Mapping Matrices,"  We propose that the smallness of the light quark masses is related to the
smallness of the T violation in hadronic weak interactions. Accordingly, for
each of the two quark sectors (""upper"" and ""lower"") we construct a 3\times 3
mass matrix in a bases of unobserved quark states, such that the ""upper""and
""lower"" basis states correspond exactly via the $W^\pm$ transitions in the weak
interaction. In the zeroth approximation of our formulation, we assume T
conservation by making all matrix elements real. In addition, we impose a
""hidden symmetry"" (invariance under simultaneous translations of all three
basis quark states in each sector), which ensures a zero mass eigenstate in
each sector.
  Next, we simultaneously break the hidden symmetry and T invariance by
introducing a phase factor e^{i\chi} in the interaction for each sector. The
Jarlskog invariant J_{CKM}, as well as the light quark masses are evaluated in
terms of the parameters of the model. We find a simple relation with
J_{CKM}=(m_dm_s/m_b^2)^{1/2}A\lambda^3\cos(\chi/2), with A and \lambda the
Wolfenstein parameters. Setting J_{CKM}=3.08 \times 10^{-5}, m_b=4.7GeV,
m_s=95MeV, A=0.818 and \lambda=0.227, we find m_d\cos^2(\chi/2) \simeq 2.4MeV,
consistent with the accepted value m_d=3-7MeV.
  We make a parallel proposal for the lepton sectors. With the hidden symmetry
and in the approximation of T invariance, both the masses of e and \nu_1 are
zero. The neutrino mapping matrix V_\nu is shown to be of the same
Harrison-Scott form which is in agreement with experiments. We also examine the

J_{CKM}=(m_dm_s/m_b^2)^{1/2}A\lambda^3\cos(\chi/2), with A and \lambda the
Wolfenstein parameters. Setting J_{CKM}=3.08 \times 10^{-5}, m_b=4.7GeV,
m_s=95MeV, A=0.818 and \lambda=0.227, we find m_d\cos^2(\chi/2) \simeq 2.4MeV,
consistent with the accepted value m_d=3-7MeV.
  We make a parallel proposal for the lepton sectors. With the hidden symmetry
and in the approximation of T invariance, both the masses of e and \nu_1 are
zero. The neutrino mapping matrix V_\nu is shown to be of the same
Harrison-Scott form which is in agreement with experiments. We also examine the
correction due to T violation, and evaluate the corresponding Jarlskog
invariant {\cal J}_\nu.

Hdelta, Hgamma, Mgb, Fe5270 and Fe5335 within the central r_e/8. By inverting
single-stellar population models, luminosity-weighted mean ages, metallicities
and alpha-element abundance ratios are derived. We estimate the amount of
fading a galaxy has undergone by comparing each galaxy's S_N with its deviation
from the mean spiral S_N. Galaxies with higher S_N have older stellar
populations. Moreover, we find that the zero-point and amount of fading is
consistent with a scenario where lenticulars are formed by the quenching of
star formation in spiral galaxies. Our data also rule out any formation method
for S0s which creates a large number of new globular clusters. We confirm that
previous results showing a relationship between S_N and color are driven by the

activity, during memory recall or during sleep, has been hypothesized to
preferentially potentiate strong synapses, preserving memories. This hypothesis
has not been evaluated in the context of a mathematical model representing
biochemical pathways important for L-LTP. I incorporated ongoing activity into
two such models: a reduced model that represents some of the essential
biochemical processes, and a more detailed published model. The reduced model
represents synaptic tagging and gene induction intuitively, and the detailed
model adds activation of essential kinases by Ca. Ongoing activity was modeled
as continual brief elevations of [Ca]. In each model, two stable states of
synaptic weight resulted. Positive feedback between synaptic weight and the
amplitude of ongoing Ca transients underlies this bistability. A tetanic or
theta-burst stimulus switches a model synapse from a low weight to a high

communication systems as automotive multi-media busses or in-house Ethernet

  The requirements of bandwidth are increasing very fast in these sectors and
therefore solutions that satisfy these demands are of high actuality. One
solution is to use the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique. Here,
several different wavelengths can carry information over one POF fiber. All
wavelengths that are transmitted over the fiber, must be separated at the
receiver to regain and redirect the information channels. These separators are
so-called Demultiplexers.
  There are several systems available on the market, which are all afflicted
with certain disadvantages. But all these solutions have one main disadvantage,
they are all too expensive for most of the applications mentioned above. So the

is the subset of elements in g x g whose subspace generated by the components
is contained in the nilpotent cone of g. The main result of this note is that
the nilpotent bicone is a complete intersection. This affirmatively answers a
conjecture of Kraft-Wallach concerning the nullcone. In addition, we introduce
and study the characteristic submodule of g. The properties of the nilpotent
bicone and the characteristic submodule are known to be very important for the
understanding of the commuting variety and its ideal of definition. In order to
study the nilpotent bicone, we introduce another subvariety, the principal
bicone. The nilpotent bicone, as well as the principal bicone, are linked to
jet schemes. We study their dimensions using arguments from motivic

and the glassy fraction always coexist, being together either nonzero or zero.
In the presence of disorder, the condensate fraction becomes a nonmonotonic

  We analyze a possible experimental configuration appropriate to massive
two-particle singlet wavefunctions and find that as long as the particles are
not ultra-relativistic, a locality loophole exists and Dirac wave(s) can
propagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to the
other detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a local

  We also propose a physical effect due to changing magnetic fields in a

0704.2345,On Predicting the Solar Cycle using Mean-Field Models,"  We discuss the difficulties of predicting the solar cycle using mean-field
models. Here we argue that these difficulties arise owing to the significant
modulation of the solar activity cycle, and that this modulation arises owing
to either stochastic or deterministic processes. We analyse the implications
for predictability in both of these situations by considering two separate
solar dynamo models. The first model represents a stochastically-perturbed flux
transport dynamo. Here even very weak stochastic perturbations can give rise to
significant modulation in the activity cycle. This modulation leads to a loss
of predictability. In the second model, we neglect stochastic effects and
assume that generation of magnetic field in the Sun can be described by a fully
deterministic nonlinear mean-field model -- this is a best case scenario for
prediction. We designate the output from this deterministic model (with
parameters chosen to produce chaotically modulated cycles) as a target
timeseries that subsequent deterministic mean-field models are required to
predict. Long-term prediction is impossible even if a model that is correct in
all details is utilised in the prediction. Furthermore, we show that even
short-term prediction is impossible if there is a small discrepancy in the
input parameters from the fiducial model. This is the case even if the
predicting model has been tuned to reproduce the output of previous cycles.
Given the inherent uncertainties in determining the transport coefficients and
nonlinear responses for mean-field models, we argue that this makes predicting
the solar cycle using the output from such models impossible.

For all cases, we discuss efficient semiparametric estimators. An estimator

collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms on the scattering polarization signals
of the 13 lines of multiplet 42 of Ti I and on those of the K line and of the

upper-level collisional depolarization turns out to have an unnoticeable impact
on the emergent linear polarization amplitudes, except for the ${\lambda 4536$

the collisional transfer rates. Concerning the Ca II lines, we show that the

  with and without magnetic reconnection","  It is generally believed that the magnetic free energy accumulated in the
corona serves as a main energy source for solar explosions such as coronal mass
ejections (CMEs). In the framework of the flux rope catastrophe model for CMEs,
the energy may be abruptly released either by an ideal magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) catastrophe, which belongs to a global magnetic topological instability
of the system, or by a fast magnetic reconnection across preexisting or
rapidly-developing electric current sheets. Both ways of magnetic energy
release are thought to be important to CME dynamics. To disentangle their
contributions, we construct a flux rope catastrophe model in the corona and
solar wind and compare different cases in which we either prohibit or allow
magnetic reconnection to take place across rapidly-growing current sheets
during the eruption. It is demonstrated that CMEs, even fast ones, can be
produced taking the ideal MHD catastrophe as the only process of magnetic
energy release. Nevertheless, the eruptive speed can be significantly enhanced
after magnetic reconnection sets in. In addition, a smooth transition from slow
to fast eruptions is observed when increasing the strength of the background
magnetic field, simply because in a stronger field there is more free magnetic
energy at the catastrophic point available to be released during an eruption.
This suggests that fast and slow CMEs may have an identical driving mechanism.

predominantly triaxial. Overall subhalos are more spherical than the host halo,
with minor to major and intermediate to major axis ratios of 0.68 and 0.83,
respectively. Like isolated halos, subhalos tend to be less spherical in their
central regions. The principal axis ratios are independent of subhalo mass,
when the shapes are measured within a physical scale like r_Vmax, the radius of
the peak of the circular velocity curve. Subhalos tend to be slightly more
spherical closer to the host halo center. The spatial distribution of the
subhalos traces the prolate shape of the host halo when they are selected by
the largest V_max they ever had, i.e. before they experienced strong tidal mass
loss. The subhalos' orientation is not random: the major axis tends to align
with the direction towards the host halo center. This alignment disappears for
halos beyond 3 r_200 and is more pronounced when the shapes are measured in the

studied within a nonlocal chiral quark model of the NJL type coupled to a
Polyakov loop. In contrast to previous investigations which were restricted to
the mean-field approximation, mesonic correlations are included by evaluating
the quark-antiquark ring sum. For physical pion masses, we find that the pions
dominate the pressure below the phase transition, whereas above T_c the
pressure is well described by the mean-field approximation result. For large

analysis, yielding 1/8, 1/4 and 1/2 BPS configurations, respectively (where in
the last step we take the Hopf fibration of S^3). The 1/8 BPS geometries, which

determined by solving a non-linear equation for the Kahler metric on the base.
Similarly, the 1/4 BPS configurations have an S^3 x S^1 isometry and a

Monge-Ampere type equation.
  Despite the non-linearity of the problem, we develop a universal bubbling AdS

energy distribution for 2MASS J04381486+2611399 and model it in terms of a
young brown dwarf surrounded by an irradiated accretion disk. The presence of
both silicate absorption at 10 um and silicate emission at 11 um constrains the
inclination of the disk to be ~70 deg, i.e. ~20 deg from edge-on. Additional
evidence of the high inclination of this disk is provided by our detection of
asymmetric bipolar extended emission surrounding 2MASS J04381486+2611399 in
high-resolution optical images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope.
According to our modeling for the SED and images of this system, the disk
contains a large inner hole that is indicative of a transition disk (R_in~58
R_star~0.275 AU) and is somewhat larger than expected from embryo ejection
models (R_out=20-40 AU vs. R_out<10-20 AU).

0705.0511,"Vibration-Induced Conductivity Fluctuation Measurement for Soil Bulk
  Density Analysis","  Soil bulk density affects water storage, water and nutrient movement, and
plant root activity in the soil profile. Its measurement is difficult in field
conditions. Vibration-induced conductivity fluctuation was investigated to
quantify soil bulk density with possible field applications in the future. The
AC electrical conductivity of soil was measured using a pair of blade-like
electrodes while exposing the soil to periodic vibration. The blades were
positioned longitudinally and transversally to the direction of the induced
vibration to enable the calculation of a normalized index. The normalized index
was expected to provide data independent from the vibration strength and to
reduce the effect of soil salinity and water content. The experiment was
conducted on natural and salinized fine sand at two moisture conditions and
four bulk densities. The blade-shaped electrodes improved electrode-soil
contact compared to cylindrical electrodes, and thereby, reduced measurement
noise. Simulations on a simplified resistor lattice indicate that the
transversal effect increases as soil bulk density decreases. Measurement of dry
sand showed a negative correlation between the normalized conductivity
fluctuation and soil bulk density for both longitudinal and transversal
settings. The decrease in the transversal signal was smaller than expected. The
wet natural and salinized soils performed very similarly as hypothesized, but
their normalized VICOF response was not significant to bulk density changes.

sufficiently high, the driven granular gas exhibits, in some range of average
densities, negative compressibility in the directions parallel to the driving
wall. When the lateral dimensions of the container are sufficiently large, the
negative compressibility causes spontaneous symmetry breaking of the basic
steady state and a phase separation instability. Event-driven molecular
dynamics simulations confirm and complement our theoretical predictions.

cm line from neutral hydrogen clouds in spiral galaxies reveal that the
rotational velocities remain nearly constant at a value v_c ~ 10^{-3}--10^{-4}
in the units of the speed of light in the region of the galactic halo. Using
the smallness of v_c, we develop a perturbative scheme for reconstructing the
metric in a galactic halo. In the leading order of expansion in v_c, at the
distances r \gtrsim v_c \ell, our result reproduces that obtained in the
Randall-Sundrum braneworld model. This inequality is satisfied in a real spiral
galaxy such as our Milky Way for distances r ~ 3 kpc, at which the rotational
velocity curve becomes flat, v_c ~ 7 \times 10^{-4}, if \ell \lesssim 2 Mpc.
The gravitational situation in this case can be approximately described by the
Einstein equations with the so-called Weyl fluid playing the role of dark
matter. In the region near the gravitating body, we derive a closed system of

  Radio Supernovae","  Massive stars, supernovae (SNe), and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
have a huge impact on their environment. Despite their importance, a
comprehensive knowledge of which massive stars produce which SN/GRB is hitherto
lacking. We present a brief overview about our knowledge of mass loss in the
Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) covering evolutionary phases of the OB main
sequence, the unstable Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage, and the Wolf-Rayet
(WR) phase. Despite the fact that metals produced by ``self-enrichment'' in WR
atmospheres exceed the initial -- host galaxy -- metallicity, by orders of
magnitude, a particularly strong dependence of the mass-loss rate on the
initial metallicity is found for WR stars at sub-solar metallicities (1/10 --
1/100 solar). This provides a significant boost to the collapsar model for
GRBs, as it may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular
momentum by stellar winds at low metallicity, whilst strong Galactic WR winds
may inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities. Furthermore, we discuss
recently reported quasi-sinusoidal modulations in the radio lightcurves of SNe
2001ig and 2003bg. We show that both the sinusoidal behaviour and the
recurrence timescale of these modulations are consistent with the predicted
mass-loss behaviour of LBVs, and we suggest LBVs may be the progenitors of some

  Radio Supernovae   Massive stars, supernovae (SNe), and long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
have a huge impact on their environment. Despite their importance, a
comprehensive knowledge of which massive stars produce which SN/GRB is hitherto
lacking. We present a brief overview about our knowledge of mass loss in the
Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) covering evolutionary phases of the OB main
sequence, the unstable Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stage, and the Wolf-Rayet
(WR) phase. Despite the fact that metals produced by ``self-enrichment'' in WR
atmospheres exceed the initial -- host galaxy -- metallicity, by orders of
magnitude, a particularly strong dependence of the mass-loss rate on the
initial metallicity is found for WR stars at sub-solar metallicities (1/10 --
1/100 solar). This provides a significant boost to the collapsar model for
GRBs, as it may present a viable mechanism to prevent the loss of angular
momentum by stellar winds at low metallicity, whilst strong Galactic WR winds
may inhibit GRBs occurring at solar metallicities. Furthermore, we discuss
recently reported quasi-sinusoidal modulations in the radio lightcurves of SNe
2001ig and 2003bg. We show that both the sinusoidal behaviour and the
recurrence timescale of these modulations are consistent with the predicted
mass-loss behaviour of LBVs, and we suggest LBVs may be the progenitors of some
core-collapse SNe.

resolutions down to 0.085arcsec, corresponding to length scales of less than
10pc in some objects. Our data were taken mostly with the near infrared
adaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profiles
typically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs. In two cases there is
unambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In the
nuclear regions there appear to have been recent - but no longer active -
starbursts in the last 10-300Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a few
percent of the AGN in the central 10pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales the
luminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows a
similar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to
10^{13}L_sun/kpc^2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density
exceeds 10^4M_sun/pc^2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limited
and hence inevitably short-lived, implying that the starbursts occur in
multiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50--100Myr between the onset
of star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We discuss whether
this may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play in
fuelling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds and
supernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted.
On the other hand winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss,
and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.

translation into protein molecules [J. Lewis, Current Biol. {\bf 13}, 1398

couples these oscillators and a longitudinal positional information signal in
the form of an Fgf8 gradient exists that could be used to transform these
coupled temporal oscillations into the observed spatial periodicity of somites.

0704.3394,"Modelling the energy dependencies of high-frequency QPO in black hole
  X-ray binaries","  We model energy dependencies of the quasi periodic oscillations (QPO) in the
model of disc epicyclic motions, with X-ray modulation caused by varying
relativistic effects. The model was proposed to explain the high frequency QPO
observed in X-ray binaries. We consider two specific scenarios for the geometry
of accretion flow and spectral formation. Firstly, a standard cold accretion
disc with an active X-ray emitting corona is assumed to oscillate. Secondly,
only a hot X-ray emitting accretion flow oscillates, while the cold disc is
absent at the QPO radius. We find that the QPO spectra are generally similar to
the spectrum of radiation emitted at the QPO radius, and they are broadened by
the relativistic effects. In particular, the QPO spectrum contains the disc
component in the oscillating disc with a corona scenario. We also review the
available data on energy dependencies of high frequency QPO, and we point out
that they appear to lack the disc component in their energy spectra. This would
suggest the hot flow geometry in the spectral states when high frequency QPO

interface between a cuprous oxide slab and a polystyrene micro-sphere placed on
the slab. The evanescent field of the resonant whispering gallery mode (WGM)
has a substantial gradient, and therefore effectively couples with the
quadrupole $1S$ excitons in cuprous oxide. This evanescent polariton has a long
life-time ($1.7 ns$), which is determined only by its excitonic component. The
polariton lower branch has a well pronounced minimum. This suggests that this
excitation can be utilized for BEC. The spatial coherence of the polariton can
be improved by assembling the micro-spheres in a linear chain.

discussing for this system the second aspect enumerated above, we derive from

often make headlines, by discussing and discovering evidence about political
events and facts. Often blogs link to one another, creating a publicly

turbulent and magnetic stresses, and (2) ""resistive"" redistribution of mass
with respect to the magnetic flux arising from the imperfect conduction of
current. In steady state, self-consistency between the two rates of drift
requires that a relationship exists between the coefficients of turbulent
viscosity and turbulent resistivity. Ignoring any interactions with a stellar
magnetosphere, we solve the steady-state equations for a magnetized disk under
the gravitational attraction of a mass point and threaded by an amount of
magnetic flux consistent with calculations of magnetized gravitational collapse
in star formation. Our model mean-field equations have an exact analytical
solution that corresponds to magnetically diluted Keplerian rotation about the
central mass point. The solution yields the strength of the magnetic field and
the surface density as functions of radial position in the disk and their
connection with the departure from pure Keplerian rotation in representative
cases. We compare the predictions of the theory with the available observations
concerning T Tauri stars, FU Orionis stars, and low- and high-mass protostars.

modeling. The ensemble members are represented as the composition of one common
state with a spatial transformation, called registration mapping, plus a
residual. A fully automatic registration method is used that requires only
gridded data, so the features in the model state do not need to be identified
by the user. The morphing EnKF operates on a transformed state consisting of
the registration mapping and the residual. Essentially, the morphing EnKF uses
intermediate states obtained by morphing instead of linear combinations of the

predicts multiple collapse of condensation, followed by the final acceleration

  Medium   We present a new model for the propagation of polarized light in a random
birefringent medium. This model is based on a decomposition of the higher order
statistics of the reduced Stokes parameters along the irreducible
representations of the rotation group. We show how this model allows a detailed
description of the propagation, giving analytical expressions for the
probability densities of the Mueller matrix and the Stokes vector throughout
the propagation. It also allows an exact description of the evolution of
averaged quantities, such as the degree of polarization. We will also discuss
how this model allows a generalization of the concepts of reduced Stokes
parameters and degree of polarization to higher order statistics. We give some
notes on how it can be extended to more general random media.

resulted in a formal 3 sigma detection, but residual systematic effects make

in particular to the random satisfiability of boolean formulas and to the
coloring of random graphs. The computation is first performed in random tree
ensembles, for which we underline a connection with percolation models and with
the reconstruction problem of information theory. The validity of these results
for the original random ensembles is then discussed in the framework of the

by Pouliquen and coworkers, predicting a linear dependence of shear band

This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation

quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric
orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry

previous claims of large timing irregularities in these data. In the dipole
spin-down formalism, the 2-sigma upper limit on period derivative implies an

  experimental study of the mean axisymmetric flow","  In order to explore the magnetostrophic regime expected for planetary cores,
experiments have been conducted in a rotating sphere filled with liquid sodium,
with an imposed dipolar magnetic field (the DTS setup). The field is produced
by a permanent magnet enclosed in an inner sphere, which can rotate at a
separate rate, producing a spherical Couette flow. The flow properties are
investigated by measuring electric potentials on the outer sphere, the induced
magnetic field in the laboratory frame, and velocity profiles inside the liquid
sodium using ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry. The present article focuses on the
time-averaged axisymmetric part of the flow. The Doppler profiles show that the
angular velocity of the fluid is relatively uniform in most of the fluid shell,
but rises near the inner sphere, revealing the presence of a magnetic wind, and
gently drops towards the outer sphere. The transition from a magnetostrophic
flow near the inner sphere to a geostrophic flow near the outer sphere is
controlled by the local Elsasser number. For Rossby numbers up to order 1, the
observed velocity profiles all show a similar shape. Numerical simulations in
the linear regime are computed, and synthetic velocity profiles are compared
with the measured ones. In the geostrophic region, a torque-balance model
provides very good predictions. We find that the induced magnetic field varies
in a consistent fashion, and displays a peculiar peak in the counter-rotating
regime. This happens when the fluid rotation rate is almost equal and opposite
to the outer sphere rotation rate. The fluid is then almost at rest in the

(4.6--13.4um) and MIR-L (12.6--26.5um) channels use 256 x 256 Si:As impurity
band conduction arrays. Each of the three channels has a field-of-view of about
10' x 10' and are operated simultaneously. The NIR and MIR-S share the same
field-of-view by virtue of a beam splitter. The MIR-L observes the sky about
$25' away from the NIR/MIR-S field-of-view. IRC gives us deep insights into the
formation and evolution of galaxies, the evolution of planetary disks, the
process of star-formation, the properties of interstellar matter under various
physical conditions, and the nature and evolution of solar system objects. The
in-flight performance of IRC has been confirmed to be in agreement with the
pre-flight expectation. This paper summarizes the design and the in-flight
operation and imaging performance of IRC.

the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products
of system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of
the quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit

galaxy M33. It is based on eight existing catalogs wherein we have
cross-referenced identifications and endeavored to resolve inconsistencies
between them. Our catalog contains 451 candidates of which 255 are confirmed
clusters based on HST and high resolution ground-based imaging. The catalog
contains precise cluster positions (RA and Dec), magnitudes and colors in the
UBVRIJHKs filters, metallicities, radial velocities, masses and ages, where
available, and galactocentric distances for each cluster. The color
distribution of the M33 clusters appears to be similar to those in the Large
Magellanic Cloud with major peaks at (B-V)o~0.15, and (B-V)o~0.65. The
intrinsic colors are correlated with cluster ages, which range from 10^{7.5} to
10^{10.3} years. The age distribution of the star clusters supports the notion
of rapid cluster disruption with a slope of alpha=-1.09 +/- 0.07 in the
dN_{cluster}/dt ~ t^{alpha} relation. In addition, comparison to theoretical
single stellar population models suggests the presence of an age-metallicity
relation among these clusters with younger clusters being more metal-rich.
Analysis of the radial distribution of the clusters yields some evidence that
younger clusters (age <~ 1 Gyr) may be more concentrated toward the center of
M33 than older ones. A similar comparison with the radial profile of the M33

0705.2619,The Transition Zone in Balmer-Dominated Shocks,"  We examine the structure of the post-shock region in supernova remnants
(SNRs). The ``shock transition zone'' is set up by charge transfer and
ionization events between atoms and ions, and has a width $\sim 10^{15}$
cm$^{-2}$ $n^{-1}_0$, where $n_0$ is the total pre-shock density (including
both atoms and ions). For Balmer-dominated SNRs with shock velocity $v_s
\gtrsim 1000$ km s$^{-1}$, the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for ion velocity and
temperature are obeyed instantly, leaving the full width at half-maximum (FWHM)
of the broad H$\alpha$ line versus $v_s$ relation intact. However, the spatial
variation in the post-shock densities is relevant to the problem of Ly$\alpha$
resonant scattering in young, core-collapse SNRs. Both two- (pre-shock atoms
and ions) and three-component (pre-shock atoms, broad neutrals and ions) models
are considered. We compute the spatial emissivities of the broad ($\xi_b$) and
narrow ($\xi_n$) H$\alpha$ lines; a calculation of these emissivities in SN
1006 is in general agreement with the computed ones of Raymond et al. (2007).
The (dimensionless) spatial shift, $\Theta_{\rm{shift}}$, between the centroids
of $\xi_b$ and $\xi_n$ is unique for a given shock velocity and $f_{\rm{ion}}$,
the pre-shock ion fraction. Measurements of $\Theta_{\rm{shift}}$ can be used

0705.4380,Plasma Modes Along the Open Field Lines of a Neutron Star,"  We consider electrostatic plasma modes along the open field lines of a
rotating neutron star. Goldreich-Julian charge density in general relativity is
analyzed for the neutron star with zero inclination. It is found that the
charge density is maximum at the polar cap and it remains almost same in
certain extended region of the pole. For a steady state Goldreich-Julian charge
density we found the usual plasma oscillation along the field lines; plasma
frequency resembles to the gravitational redshift close to the Schwarzschild
radius. We study the nonlinear plasma mode along the field lines. From the
system of equations under general relativity, a second order differential
equation is derived. The equation contains a term which describes the growing
plasma modes near Schwarzschild radius in a black hole environment. The term
vanishes with the distance far away from the gravitating object. For initially
zero potential and field on the surface of a neutron star, Goldreich-Julian
charge density is found to create the plasma mode, which is enhanced and
propagates almost without damping along the open field lines. We briefly
outline our plan to extend the work for studying soliton propagation along the

two families according to their $u-r$ colours. The total sample consists of
10865 galaxies. As expected, the highest fraction of galaxies (62%) turned to
be early-type (red) ones, being located at smaller distances from the cluster
centre and showing lower velocity dispersions than late-type (blue) ones. The
brightest cluster galaxies are located in the innermost regions and show the
smallest velocity dispersions. Early-type galaxies also show constant velocity
dispersion profiles inside the virial radius and a mild decline in the
outermost regions. In contrast, late-type galaxies show always decreasing
velocity dispersions profiles. No correlation has been found between the
fraction of blue galaxies and cluster global properties, such as cluster
velocity dispersion and galaxy concentration. In contrast, we found correlation

Our analysis considers for the first time generic graph vertices of valence

characterizes the spectral properties of the volume operator, in particular the
presence of a `volume gap' (a smallest non-zero eigenvalue in the spectrum) is
found to depend on the vertex embedding. We compute the set of all
non-spatially diffeomorphic non-coplanar vertex embeddings for vertices of
valence 5--7, and argue that these sets can be used to label spatial
diffeomorphism invariant states. We observe how gauge invariance connects

included, for which the presence of a volume gap is proved. This paper presents
our main results; details are provided by a companion paper arXiv:0706.0382v1.

several strong soft X-ray emission lines, chiefly from hydrogen-like and
helium-like oxygen, nitrogen, neon and carbon. Radiative recombination continua
(RRC) from oxygen and carbon are also detected. Our analysis suggests that the
emission data are consistent with photoionization. Using the CLOUDY
photoionization code, we found that, while a two-component, high column density
model (10e23 cm-2) with low covering factor proved adequate in reproducing all
detected Lyman series lines, it proved insufficient in modeling He-like
triplets observed (neon, oxygen, and nitrogen). If resonance line data were
ignored, the two-component model was sufficient to match flux from
intercombination and forbidden lines. However, with the inclusion of resonance
line data, He-like triplets could no longer be modeled with only two

anomalous in parameter space investigated. We investigated, and were forced to
dismiss, the possibility that a third purely collisional component could be

weighted network model with accelerating growth. We derive analytical
expressions for the evolutions and distributions for strength, degree, and

accelerating growth determines the clustering coefficient of the networks.
Interestingly, the distributions for strength, degree, and weight display a
transition from scale-free to exponential form when the parameter with respect

0704.0674,Three Different Types of Galaxy Alignment within Dark Matter Halos,"  Using a large galaxy group catalogue based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Data Release 4 we measure three different types of intrinsic galaxy alignment
within groups: halo alignment between the orientation of the brightest group
galaxies (BGG) and the distribution of its satellite galaxies, radial alignment
between the orientation of a satellite galaxy and the direction towards its
BGG, and direct alignment between the orientation of the BGG and that of its
satellites. In agreement with previous studies we find that satellite galaxies
are preferentially located along the major axis. In addition, on scales r < 0.7
Rvir we find that red satellites are preferentially aligned radially with the
direction to the BGG. The orientations of blue satellites, however, are
perfectly consistent with being isotropic. Finally, on scales r < 0.1 \Rvir, we
find a weak but significant indication for direct alignment between satellites
and BGGs. We briefly discuss the implications for weak lensing measurements.

coefficient associated to the normal fluid component of the superfluid. In our

to include scale breaking effects proportional to the square of the strange
quark mass m_s. We compute the bulk viscosity at leading order in the scale
breaking parameter, and find that it is dominated by collinear splitting and
joining processes. The resulting transport coefficient is zeta=0.011 m_s^4/T,
growing at low temperature T until the phonon fluid description stops making

absorbing dispersive sphere in the framework of complex angular momentum
techniques. We assume that the dielectric function of the sphere presents a
Drude-like behavior or an ionic crystal behavior modelling metallic and
semiconducting materials. We more particularly emphasize and interpret the
modifications induced in the resonance spectrum by absorption. We prove that
""resonant surface polariton modes"" are generated by a unique surface wave,
i.e., a surface (plasmon or phonon) polariton, propagating close to the sphere
surface. This surface polariton corresponds to a particular Regge pole of the
electric part (TM) of the S matrix of the sphere. From the associated Regge
trajectory we can construct semiclassically the spectrum of the complex
frequencies of the resonant surface polariton modes which can be considered as
Breit-Wigner-type resonances. Furthermore, by taking into account the Stokes
phenomenon, we derive an asymptotic expression for the position in the complex
angular momentum plane of the surface polariton Regge pole. We then describe
semiclassically the surface polariton and provide analytical expressions for
its dispersion relation and its damping in the non-absorbing and absorbing

well-isolated terms directly linked to absorption. Finally, we explain why the

0704.0291,Approaching the Heisenberg limit in an atom laser,"  We present experimental and theoretical results showing the improved beam
quality and reduced divergence of an atom laser produced by an optical Raman
transition, compared to one produced by an RF transition. We show that Raman
outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on
the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom
laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experiments
with tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atom
lasers whose quality is only limited by the wavefunction shape of the
condensate that produces them, typically a factor of 1.3 above the Heisenberg
limit.

0704.3405,Estimation Diversity and Energy Efficiency in Distributed Sensing,"  Distributed estimation based on measurements from multiple wireless sensors
is investigated. It is assumed that a group of sensors observe the same
quantity in independent additive observation noises with possibly different
variances. The observations are transmitted using amplify-and-forward (analog)
transmissions over non-ideal fading wireless channels from the sensors to a
fusion center, where they are combined to generate an estimate of the observed
quantity. Assuming that the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) is used by
the fusion center, the equal-power transmission strategy is first discussed,
where the system performance is analyzed by introducing the concept of
estimation outage and estimation diversity, and it is shown that there is an
achievable diversity gain on the order of the number of sensors. The optimal
power allocation strategies are then considered for two cases: minimum
distortion under power constraints; and minimum power under distortion
constraints. In the first case, it is shown that by turning off bad sensors,
i.e., sensors with bad channels and bad observation quality, adaptive power
gain can be achieved without sacrificing diversity gain. Here, the adaptive
power gain is similar to the array gain achieved in Multiple-Input
Single-Output (MISO) multi-antenna systems when channel conditions are known to
the transmitter. In the second case, the sum power is minimized under
zero-outage estimation distortion constraint, and some related energy
efficiency issues in sensor networks are discussed.

transmissions over non-ideal fading wireless channels from the sensors to a
fusion center, where they are combined to generate an estimate of the observed
quantity. Assuming that the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) is used by
the fusion center, the equal-power transmission strategy is first discussed,
where the system performance is analyzed by introducing the concept of
estimation outage and estimation diversity, and it is shown that there is an
achievable diversity gain on the order of the number of sensors. The optimal
power allocation strategies are then considered for two cases: minimum
distortion under power constraints; and minimum power under distortion
constraints. In the first case, it is shown that by turning off bad sensors,
i.e., sensors with bad channels and bad observation quality, adaptive power
gain can be achieved without sacrificing diversity gain. Here, the adaptive
power gain is similar to the array gain achieved in Multiple-Input
Single-Output (MISO) multi-antenna systems when channel conditions are known to
the transmitter. In the second case, the sum power is minimized under
zero-outage estimation distortion constraint, and some related energy
efficiency issues in sensor networks are discussed.

0705.4302,Truecluster matching,"  Cluster matching by permuting cluster labels is important in many clustering
contexts such as cluster validation and cluster ensemble techniques. The
classic approach is to minimize the euclidean distance between two cluster
solutions which induces inappropriate stability in certain settings. Therefore,
we present the truematch algorithm that introduces two improvements best
explained in the crisp case. First, instead of maximizing the trace of the
cluster crosstable, we propose to maximize a chi-square transformation of this
crosstable. Thus, the trace will not be dominated by the cells with the largest
counts but by the cells with the most non-random observations, taking into
account the marginals. Second, we suggest a probabilistic component in order to
break ties and to make the matching algorithm truly random on random data. The
truematch algorithm is designed as a building block of the truecluster
framework and scales in polynomial time. First simulation results confirm that
the truematch algorithm gives more consistent truecluster results for unequal
cluster sizes. Free R software is available.

work, the program of renormalization with flow equations is reviewed and then
extended to effective field theories that have a finite UV cutoff. This is done
for a scalar field theory by imposing additional renormalization conditions for
some of the nonrenormalizable couplings. It turns out that one so obtains a
statement on the predictivity of the effective theory at scales far below the

equations. A fine-tuning procedure for restoring the violated Slavnov-Taylor

behavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a
directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.
It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is
manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that
circuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients
of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those
coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral
dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been
studied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.
The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of
existing memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in
classical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has
been introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and
produces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even
be impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible
explanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain
has been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential
behavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance

discuss how the velocity overlap of two other outflowing systems in the same

system has one unblended transition and one transition which overlaps with
absorption from the other system. The residual flux in the overlapping trough
is well fit by the product of the residual fluxes in the unblended troughs. For
these optically thick systems to yield such a result, at least one of them must
consist of individual subunits rather than being a single structure with
velocity-dependent coverage of the source. If these subunits are identical,
opaque, spherical clouds, we estimate the cloud radius to be r = 3.9 10^15 cm.
If they are identical, opaque, linear filaments, we estimate their width to be
w = 6.5 10^14 cm. These subunits are observed to cover the Mg II broad emission
line region of the quasar, at which distance from the black hole the above
filament width is equal to the predicted scale height of the outer atmosphere
of a thin accretion disk. Insofar as that scale height is a natural size scale
for structures originating in an accretion disk, these observations are
evidence that the accretion disk can be a source of quasar absorption systems.

0705.0183,Normalizers of Irreducible Subfactors,"  We consider normalizers of an irreducible inclusion $N\subseteq M$ of
$\mathrm{II}_1$ factors. In the infinite index setting an inclusion
$uNu^*\subseteq N$ can be strict, forcing us to also investigate the semigroup
of one-sided normalizers. We relate these normalizers of $N$ in $M$ to
projections in the basic construction and show that every trace one projection
in the relative commutant $N'\cap < M,e_N>$ is of the form $u^*e_Nu$ for some
unitary $u\in M$ with $uNu^*\subseteq N$. This enables us to identify the
normalizers and the algebras they generate in several situations. In particular
each normalizer of a tensor product of irreducible subfactors is a tensor
product of normalizers modulo a unitary. We also examine normalizers of
irreducible subfactors arising from subgroup--group inclusions $H\subseteq G$.
Here the normalizers are the normalizing group elements modulo a unitary from
$L(H)$. We are also able to identify the finite trace $L(H)$-bimodules in
$\ell^2(G)$ as double cosets which are also finite unions of left cosets.

0706.0141,"The structure of hypersonic shock waves using Navier-Stokes equations
  modified to include mass diffusion","  Howard Brenner has recently proposed modifications to the Navier-Stokes
equations that relate to a diffusion of fluid volume that would be significant
for flows with high density gradients. In a previous paper (Greenshields &
Reese, 2007), we found these modifications gave good predictions of the viscous
structure of shock waves in argon in the range Mach 1.0-12.0 (while
conventional Navier-Stokes equations are known to fail above about Mach 2).
However, some areas of concern with this model were a somewhat arbitrary choice
of modelling coefficient, and potentially unphysical and unstable solutions. In
this paper, we therefore present slightly different modifications to include
molecule mass diffusion fully in the Navier-Stokes equations. These
modifications are shown to be stable and produce physical solutions to the
shock problem of a quality broadly similar to those from the family of extended
hydrodynamic models that includes the Burnett equations. The modifications
primarily add a diffusion term to the mass conservation equation, so are at
least as simple to solve as the Navier-Stokes equations; there are none of the
numerical implementation problems of conventional extended hydrodynamics
models, particularly in respect of boundary conditions. We recommend further
investigation and testing on a number of different benchmark non-equilibrium

0706.0344,"Collisional processes and size distribution in spatially extended debris
  discs","  We present a new multi-annulus code for the study of collisionally evolving
extended debris discs. We first aim to confirm results obtained for a
single-annulus system, namely that the size distribution in ""real"" debris discs
always departs from the theoretical collisional equilibrium
$dN\proptoR^{-3.5}dR$ power law, especially in the crucial size range of
observable particles (<1cm), where it displays a characteristic wavy pattern.
We also aim at studying how debris discs density distributions, scattered light
luminosity profiles, and SEDs are affected by the coupled effect of collisions
and radial mixing due to radiation pressure affected small grains. The size
distribution evolution is modeled from micron-sized grains to 50km-sized
bodies. The model takes into account the crucial influence of radiation
pressure-affected small grains. We consider the collisional evolution of a
fiducial a=120AU radius disc with an initial surface density in
$\Sigma(a)\propto a^{\alpha}$. We show that the system's radial extension plays
a crucial role: in most regions the collisional and size evolution of the dust
is imposed by small particles on eccentric or unbound orbits produced further
inside the disc. The spatial distribution of small grains strongly departs from
the initial profile, while the bigger objects, containing most of the system's
mass, still follow the initial distribution. This has consequences on the
scattered--light radial profiles which get significantly flatter, and we
propose an empirical law to trace back the distribution of large unseen parent
bodies from the observed profiles. We finally provide empirical formula for the
collisional size distribution and collision timescale that can be used for
future debris disc modeling.
",astro-ph,"Collisional processes and size distribution in spatially extended debris
  discs   We present a new multi-annulus code for the study of collisionally evolving
extended debris discs. We first aim to confirm results obtained for a
single-annulus system, namely that the size distribution in ""real"" debris discs
always departs from the theoretical collisional equilibrium
$dN\proptoR^{-3.5}dR$ power law, especially in the crucial size range of
observable particles (<1cm), where it displays a characteristic wavy pattern.
We also aim at studying how debris discs density distributions, scattered light
luminosity profiles, and SEDs are affected by the coupled effect of collisions
and radial mixing due to radiation pressure affected small grains. The size
distribution evolution is modeled from micron-sized grains to 50km-sized
bodies. The model takes into account the crucial influence of radiation
pressure-affected small grains. We consider the collisional evolution of a
fiducial a=120AU radius disc with an initial surface density in
$\Sigma(a)\propto a^{\alpha}$. We show that the system's radial extension plays
a crucial role: in most regions the collisional and size evolution of the dust
is imposed by small particles on eccentric or unbound orbits produced further
inside the disc. The spatial distribution of small grains strongly departs from
the initial profile, while the bigger objects, containing most of the system's
mass, still follow the initial distribution. This has consequences on the
scattered--light radial profiles which get significantly flatter, and we
propose an empirical law to trace back the distribution of large unseen parent
bodies from the observed profiles. We finally provide empirical formula for the
collisional size distribution and collision timescale that can be used for
future debris disc modeling.

0705.0773,"Revisiting the Fermi Golden Rule: Quantum Dynamical Phase Transition as
  a Paradigm Shift","  Classical and quantum phase transitions involve observables which are
non-analytic as functions of a controlled thermodynamical variable. As occurs
with the self-consistent Fermi Golden Rule, one condition to obtain the
discontinuous behavior is the proper evaluation of a classical or quantum
thermodynamic limit. We show that in presence of an environment, the
oscillatory dynamics of a quantum two-level system, in analogy with a classical
damped oscillator, can undergo a quantum dynamical phase transition to a
non-oscillatory phase. This is obtained from a self-consistent solution of the
Generalized Landauer Buettiker Equations, a simplified integral form of the
Keldysh formalism. I argue that working at each side of the transition implies
standing under different paradigms in the Kuhn's sense of the word. In
consequence, paradigms incommensurability obtains a sound mathematical
justification as a consequence of the non-analyticity of the observables. A
strong case is made upon the need to deepen the public's intuition and
understanding on the abrupt transition from static to dynamical friction
regimes.

by the mutual interactions of a group of massive bodies orbiting a central star
in the presence of eccentricity dissipation. For parameters relevant to the
oligarchic stage of planet formation, dynamical friction keeps the typical
eccentricities small and prevents orbit crossing. Interactions at impact
parameters greater than several Hill radii cause the protoplanets to repel each
other; if the impact parameter is instead much less than the Hill radius, the
protoplanets shift slightly in semi-major axis but remain otherwise
unperturbed. If the orbits of two or more protoplanets are separated by less
than a Hill radius, they are each pushed towards an equilibrium spacing between
their neighbors and can exist as a stable co-orbital system. In the
shear-dominated oligarchic phase of planet formation we show that the feeding
zones contain several oligarchs instead of only one. Growth of the protoplanets
in the oligarchic phase drives the disk to an equilibrium configuration that
depends on the mass ratio of protoplanets to planetesimals, $\Sigma/\sigma$.
Early in the oligarchic phase, when $\Sigma/\sigma$ is low, the spacing between
rows of co-orbital oligarchs are about 5 Hill radii wide, rather than the 10
Hill radii cited in the literature. It is likely that at the end of oligarchy
the average number of co-orbital oligarchs is greater than unity. In the outer
solar system this raises the disk mass required to form the ice giants. In the
inner solar system this lowers the mass of the final oligarchs and requires
more giant impacts than previously estimated. This result provides additional

for nonequilibrium Markovian systems. It is based on Kirchhoff's diagram

The finite baryon density provides charge carriers analogous to electrons in a

determine directly. Our result for the conductivity is good for all values of
the mass, external field and density, modulo statements about the
yet-incomplete phase diagram. In the appropriate limits it agrees with known
results obtained from analyzing small fluctuations around equilibrium. For
large mass, where we expect a good quasi-particle description, we compute the
drag force on the charge carriers and find that the answer is unchanged from
the zero density case. Our method easily generalizes to a wide class of systems
of probe branes in various backgrounds.

the Laplace expansion of the Coulomb potential which possesses a characteristic

one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential via the limit $\beta \to
0$ in previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential
$\exp \bigl(-\beta | \bm{r}-\bm{r}'| \bigr) /| \bm{r}-\bm{r}'|$. At first
sight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point
of view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases
fundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of
functions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but
Guseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal
Slater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a
dangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the
one-center limit $\bm{r}' = \bm{0}$ of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition
theorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist.
Moreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces
implicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the
Coulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition
theorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the
sense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals.

two-range form. Guseinov [Chem. Phys. {\bf 309}, 209 - 213 (2005)] derived
one-range addition theorems for the Coulomb potential via the limit $\beta \to
0$ in previously derived one-range addition theorems for the Yukawa potential
$\exp \bigl(-\beta | \bm{r}-\bm{r}'| \bigr) /| \bm{r}-\bm{r}'|$. At first
sight, this looks like a remarkable achievement, but from a mathematical point
of view, Guseinov's work is at best questionable and in some cases
fundamentally flawed. One-range addition theorems are expansions in terms of
functions that are complete and orthonormal in a given Hilbert space, but
Guseinov replaced the complete and orthonormal functions by nonorthogonal
Slater-type functions and rearranged the resulting expansions. This is a
dangerous operation whose validity must be checked. It is shown that the
one-center limit $\bm{r}' = \bm{0}$ of Guseinov's rearranged Yukawa addition
theorems as well as of several other addition theorems does not exist.
Moreover, the Coulomb potential does not belong to any of the Hilbert spaces
implicitly used by Guseinov. Accordingly, one-range addition theorems for the
Coulomb potential diverge in the mean. Instead, these one-range addition
theorems have to interpreted as expansions of generalized functions in the
sense of Schwartz that converge weakly in suitable functionals.

0706.0475,Simple shear flow in inelastic Maxwell models,"  The Boltzmann equation for inelastic Maxwell models is considered to
determine the velocity moments through fourth degree in the simple shear flow
state. First, the rheological properties (which are related to the
second-degree velocity moments) are {\em exactly} evaluated in terms of the
coefficient of restitution $\alpha$ and the (reduced) shear rate $a^*$. For a
given value of $\alpha$, the above transport properties decrease with
increasing shear rate. Moreover, as expected, the third-degree and the
asymmetric fourth-degree moments vanish in the long time limit when they are
scaled with the thermal speed. On the other hand, as in the case of elastic
collisions, our results show that, for a given value of $\alpha$, the scaled
symmetric fourth-degree moments diverge in time for shear rates larger than a
certain critical value $a_c^*(\alpha)$ which decreases with increasing
dissipation. The explicit shear-rate dependence of the fourth-degree moments
below this critical value is also obtained.

  networks based on Bose-Mesner algebra and Christoffel-Darboux identity   Recently in \cite{jss1}, the authors have given a method for calculation of
the effective resistance (resistance distance) on distance-regular networks,
where the calculation was based on stratification introduced in \cite{js} and
Stieltjes transform of the spectral distribution (Stieltjes function)
associated with the network. Also, in Ref. \cite{jss1} it has been shown that
the resistance distances between a node $\alpha$ and all nodes $\beta$
belonging to the same stratum with respect to the $\alpha$

to the $\alpha$) are the same. In this work, an algorithm for recursive

  Answering a question of Maurice Pouzet, we show that for every uncountable
cardinal $\kappa$ there are $2^\kappa$ pairwise non-isomorphic nearly ordinal
algebras of cardinality $\kappa$.
  Topologically, free Boolean algebras over posets correspond to compact
0-dimensional distributive lattices. In this context, we classify all closed
sublattices of the product $(\omega_1+1)\times(\omega_1+1)$, thus showing that
there are only $\aleph_1$ many of them. In contrast with the last result, we
show that there are $2^{\aleph_1}$ topological types of closed subsets of the
Tikhonov plank $(\omega_1+1)\times(\omega+1)$.

0705.3442,Mitigation of loss within a molecular Stark decelerator,"  The transverse motion inside a Stark decelerator plays a large role in the
total efficiency of deceleration. We differentiate between two separate regimes
of molecule loss during the slowing process. The first mechanism involves
distributed loss due to coupling of transverse and longitudinal motion, while
the second is a result of the rapid decrease of the molecular velocity within
the final few stages. In this work, we describe these effects and present means
for overcoming them. Solutions based on modified switching time sequences with
the existing decelerator geometry lead to a large gain of stable molecules in
the intermediate velocity regime, but fail to address the loss at very low
final velocities. We propose a new decelerator design, the quadrupole-guiding
decelerator, which eliminates distributed loss due to transverse/longitudinal
couplings throughout the slowing process and also exhibits gain over normal

the Milky Way potential produced by the flattened disk and the triaxial dark
matter halo, causing a change of angular momentum that can be much larger than
the initial small value at injection. We study the kinematics of HVSs and
propose an estimator of dark halo triaxiality that is determined only by
instantaneous position and velocity vectors of HVSs at large Galactocentric
distances (r>~50kpc). We show that, in the case of a substantially triaxial
halo, the distribution of deflection angles (the angle between the stellar
position and velocity vector) for HVSs on bound orbits is spread uniformly over
the range 10--180deg. Future astrometric and deep wide-field surveys should
measure the positions and velocities of a significant number of HVSs, and

hole binary candidates seen in the low/hard state except that a very hard
spectrum was seen in one of the observations. By comparing with near infrared

0704.0578,3D photospheric velocity field of a Supergranular cell,"  We investigate the plasma flow properties inside a Supergranular (SG) cell,
in particular its interaction with small scale magnetic field structures. The
SG cell has been identified using the magnetic network (CaII wing brightness)
as proxy, applying the Two-Level Structure Tracking (TST) to high spatial,
spectral and temporal resolution observations obtained by IBIS. The full 3D
velocity vector field for the SG has been reconstructed at two different
photospheric heights. In order to strengthen our findings, we also computed the
mean radial flow of the SG by means of cork tracing. We also studied the
behaviour of the horizontal and Line of Sight plasma flow cospatial with
cluster of bright CaII structures of magnetic origin to better understand the
interaction between photospheric convection and small scale magnetic features.
The SG cell we investigated seems to be organized with an almost radial flow
from its centre to the border. The large scale divergence structure is probably
created by a compact region of constant up-flow close to the cell centre. On
the edge of the SG, isolated regions of strong convergent flow are nearby or
cospatial with extended clusters of bright CaII wing features forming the knots

0705.3644,Subjective Information Measure and Rate Fidelity Theory,"  Using fish-covering model, this paper intuitively explains how to extend
Hartley's information formula to the generalized information formula step by
step for measuring subjective information: metrical information (such as
conveyed by thermometers), sensory information (such as conveyed by color
vision), and semantic information (such as conveyed by weather forecasts). The
pivotal step is to differentiate condition probability and logical condition
probability of a message. The paper illustrates the rationality of the formula,
discusses the coherence of the generalized information formula and Popper's
knowledge evolution theory. For optimizing data compression, the paper
discusses rate-of-limiting-errors and its similarity to complexity-distortion
based on Kolmogorov's complexity theory, and improves the rate-distortion
theory into the rate-fidelity theory by replacing Shannon's distortion with
subjective mutual information. It is proved that both the rate-distortion
function and the rate-fidelity function are equivalent to a
rate-of-limiting-errors function with a group of fuzzy sets as limiting
condition, and can be expressed by a formula of generalized mutual information
for lossy coding, or by a formula of generalized entropy for lossless coding.
By analyzing the rate-fidelity function related to visual discrimination and
digitized bits of pixels of images, the paper concludes that subjective
information is less than or equal to objective (Shannon's) information; there
is an optimal matching point at which two kinds of information are equal; the
matching information increases with visual discrimination (defined by confusing
probability) rising; for given visual discrimination, too high resolution of

extinction, and other relevant parameters. Using these estimated physical
conditions in methods that we have previously established, CO-to-H2 conversion

we derive and discuss the dispersion laws for the unstable collective modes. In

larger than the speed of the sound of the plasma and only modes with momenta
smaller than a certain values are unstable. Moreover, for ultrarelativistic

unstable modes correspond to relative angles between the velocity of the jet
and momentum of the collective mode larger than $\sim \pi/8$. Our results
suggest an alternative mechanism for the description of the jet quenching

an excellent diagnostic of accretion flows in the vicinity of black holes.
Previous studies have concentrated on the case of a thin, Keplerian accretion
disc. This disc must become thicker and sub-Keplerian with increasing accretion
rates. These can affect the line profiles and in turn can influence the
estimation of the accretion disc and black hole parameters from the observed
line profiles. We here embark on, for the first time, a fully relativistic

gravitational redshift and light bending. We find that the separation and the
relative height between the blue and red peaks of the line profile diminish as
the thickness of the disc increases. This code is also well-suited to produce
accretion disc images. We calculate the redshift and flux images of the

0704.2974,Spin dephasing due to a random Berry phase,"  We investigate relaxation and dephasing of an electron spin confined in a

magnetic field, B = 0, slow noise coupling to the electron's orbital degree of

Berry phase acquired by the spin. For illustration we first present a simple
quasiclassical description, then consider a model with 2 orbital states only,
and finally present a perturbative quantum treatment appropriate for an
electron in a realistic (roughly parabolic, not too strongly confining) quantum
dot. We further compare the effect of different sources of noise. While at
large magnetic fields phonons dominate the relaxation processes, at low fields
electron-hole excitations and possibly 1/f noise may dominate.

assume that a fraction of jet energy, which is generated by an AGN, is
transferred to the surrounding gas as thermal energy. Combining a theoretical
model of mass accretion onto black holes with a multiphase description of
star-forming gas, we self-consistently follow evolution of both galaxies and
their central black holes. The novelty in our model is that we consider two
distinct accretion modes: standard radiatively efficient thin accretion disks
and radiatively inefficient accretion flows which we will generically refer to
as RIAFs; motivated by theoretical models for jet production in accretion
disks, we assume that only the RIAF is responsible for the AGN feedback. We
find that, after an initial episode of bursting star formation, the accretion
rate onto the central black hole drops so that the accretion disk switches to a
RIAF structure. At this point, the feedback from the AGN becomes efficient and
slightly suppresses star formation in the galactic disk and almost completely
halts star formation in the bulge. As a result, the nucleus becomes a
stochastically fuelled low-luminosity AGN (Seyfert galaxy) with recurrent
short-lived episodes of activity after the star bursts. Our model predicts
several properties of the low-luminosity AGN including the bolometric
luminosity, jet powers, the effect on kpc-scale of the radio jet and the AGN
lifetime, which are in broad agreement with observations of Seyfert galaxies
and their radio activity. We also find that the mass ratios between the central
black hole and the the host spheroid at z = 0 are ~10^{-3} regardless of the
strength of either supernova feedback or AGN feedback. (abridged)

walks; (2) symmetric exclusion process; (3) symmetric voter model. The focus is
on the annealed Lyapunov exponents, i.e., the exponential growth rates of the
successive moments of the reactant. It turns out that these exponents exhibit
an interesting dependence on the dimension and on the diffusion constant.

0705.1603,Neutron-proton mass difference in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter,"  Isospin-breaking effects in the baryonic sector are studied in the framework
of a medium-modified Skyrme model. The neutron-proton mass difference in
infinite, asymmetric nuclear matter is discussed. In order to describe the
influence of the nuclear environment on the skyrmions, we include
energy-dependent charged and neutral pion optical potentials in the s- and
p-wave channels. The present approach predicts that the neutron-proton mass
difference is mainly dictated by its strong part and that it strongly decreases
in neutron matter.

determines both the Weyl chamber steering trajectory and the accompanying local

generate high-fidelity, single-step controlled-NOT (CNOT) logic, provided that
both qubits can be individually manipulated. The results are then applied to
superconducting qubit architectures, for which several CNOT gate

significantly influenced the cooling and collapse of primordial gas clouds in
minihaloes around redshifts of z ~ 15 - 20, provided the CR flux was sufficient
to yield an ionization rate greater than about 10^-19 s^-1 near the center of
the minihalo. The presence of CRs with energies less than approximately 10^7 eV
would indirectly enhance the molecular cooling in these regions, and we
estimate that the resulting lower temperatures in these minihaloes would yield
a characteristic stellar mass as low as ~ 10 M_sun. CRs have a less pronounced
effect on the cooling and collapse of primordial gas clouds inside more massive
dark matter haloes with virial masses greater than approximately 10^8 M_sun at
the later stages of cosmological structure formation around z ~ 10 - 15. In
these clouds, even without CR flux the molecular abundance is already
sufficient to allow cooling to the floor set by the temperature of the cosmic

mediated by an infinite tower of vector mesons, rendering the baryon

0704.3551,Modelling diffusional transport in the interphase cell nucleus,"  In this paper a lattice model for diffusional transport of particles in the
interphase cell nucleus is proposed. Dense networks of chromatin fibers are
created by three different methods: randomly distributed, non-interconnected
obstacles, a random walk chain model, and a self avoiding random walk chain
model with persistence length. By comparing a discrete and a continuous version
of the random walk chain model, we demonstrate that lattice discretization does
not alter particle diffusion. The influence of the 3D geometry of the fiber
network on the particle diffusion is investigated in detail, while varying
occupation volume, chain length, persistence length and walker size. It is
shown that adjacency of the monomers, the excluded volume effect incorporated
in the self avoiding random walk model, and, to a lesser extent, the
persistence length, affect particle diffusion. It is demonstrated how the
introduction of the effective chain occupancy, which is a convolution of the
geometric chain volume with the walker size, eliminates the conformational
effects of the network on the diffusion, i.e., when plotting the diffusion
coefficient as a function of the effective chain volume, the data fall onto a
master curve.

0706.0626,Covering Homology,"  We introduce the notion of ""covering homology"" of a commutative ring spectrum
with respect to certain families of coverings of topological spaces. The
construction of covering homology is extracted from Bokstedt, Hsiang and
Madsen's topological cyclic homology. In fact covering homology with respect to
the family of orientation preserving isogenies of the circle is equal to
topological cyclic homology.
  Our basic tool for the analysis of covering homology is a cofibration
sequence involving homotopy orbits and a restriction map similar to the
restriction map used in Bokstedt, Hsiang and Madsen's construction of
topological cyclic homology.
  Covering homology with respect to families of isogenies of a torus is
constructed from iterated topological Hochschild homology. It receives a trace
map from iterated algebraic K-theory and the hope is that the rich structure,
and the calculability of covering homology will make covering homology useful
in the exploration of J. Rognes' ``red shift conjecture''.

0706.1307,Finite-size effects in roughness distribution scaling,"  We study numerically finite-size corrections in scaling relations for
roughness distributions of various interface growth models. The most common
relation, which considers the average roughness $<w_2>$ as scaling factor, is
not obeyed in the steady states of a group of ballistic-like models in 2+1
dimensions, even when very large system sizes are considered. On the other
hand, good collapse of the same data is obtained with a scaling relation that
involves the root mean square fluctuation of the roughness, which can be
explained by finite-size effects on second moments of the scaling functions. We
also obtain data collapse with an alternative scaling relation that accounts
for the effect of the intrinsic width, which is a constant correction term
previously proposed for the scaling of $<w_2>$. This illustrates how
finite-size corrections can be obtained from roughness distributions scaling.
However, we discard the usual interpretation that the intrinsic width is a
consequence of high surface steps by analyzing data of restricted
solid-on-solid models with various maximal height differences between
neighboring columns. We also observe that large finite-size corrections in the
roughness distributions are usually accompanied by huge corrections in height
distributions and average local slopes, as well as in estimates of scaling
exponents. The molecular-beam epitaxy model of Das Sarma and Tamborenea in 1+1
dimensions is a case example in which none of the proposed scaling relations
works properly, while the other measured quantities do not converge to the
expected asymptotic values. Thus, although roughness distributions are clearly
better than other quantities to determine the universality class of a growing

breaking with d-wave symmetry, the so-called d-wave ""Pomeranchuk instability''.
We use a mean-field model of electrons with a pure forward scattering
interaction on a square lattice. When either the majority or the minority spin
band is tuned close to the van Hove filling by a magnetic field, the Fermi
surface symmetry breaking occurs in both bands, but with a different magnitude
of the order parameter. The transition is typically of second order at high
temperature and changes to first order at low temperature; the end points of
the second order line are tricritical points. This qualitative picture does not
change even in the limit of a large magnetic field, although the magnetic field
substantially suppresses the transition temperature at the van Hove filling.
The field produces neither a quantum critical point nor a quantum critical end
point in our model. In the weak coupling limit, typical quantities
characterizing the phase diagram have a field-independent single energy scale
while its dimensionless coefficient varies with the field. The field-induced
Fermi surface symmetry breaking is a promising scenario for the bilayer
ruthenate Sr3Ru2O7, and future issues are discussed to establish such a
scenario.

theory whose ungauged version admits an affine E_9 global symmetry algebra. The
various parameters (related to higher-dimensional p-form fluxes, geometric and

GNR channel shares similarities with a zigzag CNT, but it has a different

Significant increase of the minimal leakage current is observed when the

These were simulations of a pulsed, initially underdense jet in a high density

and since the jet velocity is very high, the jet bow shock and the internal
shocks are heated to high temperatures and should therefore emit X-ray
radiation. In this paper, we investigate in detail the X-ray properties of the
jets in our models. We have focused our study on the total X-ray luminosity and
its temporal variability, the resulting spectra and the spatial distribution of
the emission. Temperature and density maps from our hydrodynamical simulations
with radiative cooling presented in the second paper are used together with
emissivities calculated with the atomic database ATOMDB. The jets in our models
show extended and variable X-ray emission which can be characterized as a sum
of hot and warm components with temperatures that are consistent with
observations of CH Cyg and R Aqr. The X-ray spectra of our model jets show
emission line features which correspond to observed features in the spectra of
CH Cyg. The innermost parts of our pulsed jets show iron line emission in the

0705.0877,"Dependence of CMI Growth Rates on Electron Velocity Distributions and
  Perturbation by Solitary Waves","  We calculate growth rates and corresponding gains for RX and LO mode
radiation associated with the cyclotron maser instability for parameterized
horseshoe electron velocity distributions. The velocity distribution function
was modeled to closely fit the electron distribution functions observed in the
auroral cavity. We systematically varied the model parameters as well as the
propagation direction to study the dependence of growth rates on model
parameters. The growth rate depends strongly on loss cone opening angle, which
must be less than $90^{o}$ for significant CMI growth. The growth rate is
sharply peaked for perpendicular radiation ($k_{\parallel} = 0$), with a
full-width at half-maximum $1.7^{o}$, in good agreement with observed k-vector
orientations and numerical simulations. The fractional bandwidth varied between
10$^{-4}$ and 10$^{-2}$, depending most strongly on propagation direction. This
range encompasses nearly all observed fractional AKR burst bandwidths. We find
excellent agreement between the computed RX mode emergent intensities and
observed AKR intensities assuming convective growth length $L_c\approx$20-40 km
and group speed 0.15$c$. The only computed LO mode growth rates compatible
observed LO mode radiation levels occurred for number densities more than 100
times the average energetic electron densities measured in auroral cavities.
This implies that LO mode radiation is not produced directly by the CMI
mechanism but more likely results from mode conversion of RX mode radiation. We
find that perturbation of the model velocity distribution by large ion solitary
waves (ion holes) can enhance the growth rate by a factor of 2-4. This will
result in a gain enhancement more than 40 dB depending on the convective growth
length within the structure. Similar enhancements may be caused by EMIC waves.

allowing observations to be made from the optical to gamma-ray bands. Many
other telescopes, including Konus-Wind, XMM-Newton, ROTSE and the Faulkes
Telescope North, also observed the burst. The gamma-ray, X-ray and UV/optical
emission all showed a peak ~75s after the trigger, although the optical and
X-ray afterglow components also appear early on - before, or during, the main
peak. Spectral evolution was seen throughout the burst, with the prompt
emission showing a clear positive correlation between brightness and hardness.
The Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of the prompt emission, stretching from
1eV up to 1MeV, is very flat, with a peak in the flux density at ~1keV. The
optical-to-X-ray spectra at this time are better fitted by a broken, rather
than single, power-law, similar to previous results for X-ray flares. The SED
shows spectral hardening as the afterglow evolves with time. This behaviour
might be a symptom of self-Comptonisation, although circumstellar densities
similar to those found in the cores of molecular clouds would be required. The
afterglow also decays too slowly to be accounted for by the standard models.
Although the precursor and main emission show different spectral lags, both are
consistent with the lag-luminosity correlation for long bursts. GRB 061121 is
the instantaneously brightest long burst yet detected by Swift. Using a
combination of Swift and Konus-Wind data, we estimate an isotropic energy of

derive an algorithm for efficiently computing the dual amplitude and describe
Metropolis moves for sampling the dual ensemble. We relate our algorithms to
prior work in non-abelian dual computations of Hari Dass and his collaborators,
addressing several problems that have been left open. We report results of spin
expectation value computations over a range of lattice sizes and couplings that
are in agreement with our conventional lattice computations. We conclude with

0705.3313,IRAS 18511+0146: a proto Herbig Ae/Be cluster?,"  Context: The evolution of a young protocluster depends on the relative
spatial distributions and dynamics of both stars and gas. Aims: We study the
distribution and properties of the gas and stars surrounding the luminous (10^4
L_sun) protocluster IRAS 18511+0146. Methods: IRAS 18511+0146 and the cluster
associated with it has been investigated using the sub-millimetre (JCMT-SCUBA),
infrared (Spitzer-MIPSGAL, Spitzer-GLIMPSE, Palomar) and radio (VLA) continuum
data. Cluster simulations have been carried out in order to understand the
properties of clusters as well as to compare with the observations. Results:
The central most obscured part of the protocluster coincident with the compact
sub-millimetre source found with SCUBA is responsible for at least 2/3 of the
total luminosity. A number of cluster members have been identified which are
bright in mid infrared and show rising (near to mid infrared) spectral energy
distributions suggesting that these are very young stellar sources. In the mid
infrared 8.0 micron image, a number of filamentary structures and clumps are
detected in the vicinity of IRAS 18511+0146. Conclusions: Based on the

",astro-ph,"IRAS 18511+0146: a proto Herbig Ae/Be cluster?   Context: The evolution of a young protocluster depends on the relative
spatial distributions and dynamics of both stars and gas. Aims: We study the
distribution and properties of the gas and stars surrounding the luminous (10^4
L_sun) protocluster IRAS 18511+0146. Methods: IRAS 18511+0146 and the cluster
associated with it has been investigated using the sub-millimetre (JCMT-SCUBA),
infrared (Spitzer-MIPSGAL, Spitzer-GLIMPSE, Palomar) and radio (VLA) continuum
data. Cluster simulations have been carried out in order to understand the
properties of clusters as well as to compare with the observations. Results:
The central most obscured part of the protocluster coincident with the compact
sub-millimetre source found with SCUBA is responsible for at least 2/3 of the
total luminosity. A number of cluster members have been identified which are
bright in mid infrared and show rising (near to mid infrared) spectral energy
distributions suggesting that these are very young stellar sources. In the mid
infrared 8.0 micron image, a number of filamentary structures and clumps are
detected in the vicinity of IRAS 18511+0146. Conclusions: Based on the
luminosity and cluster size as well as on the evolutionary stages of the
cluster members, IRAS 18511+0146 is likely to be protocluster with the most
massive object being a precursor to a Herbig type star.

0704.2253,A survey of debris trails from short-period comets,"  We observed 34 comets using the 24 micron camera on the Spitzer Space
Telescope. Each image contains the nucleus and covers at least 10^6 km of each
comet's orbit. Debris trails due to mm-sized or larger particles were found
along the orbits of 27 comets; 4 comets had small-particle dust tails and a
viewing geometry that made debris trails impossible to distinguish; and only 3
had no debris trail despite favorable observing conditions. There are now 30
Jupiter-family comets with known debris trails, of which 22 are reported in
this paper for the first time. The detection rate is >80%, indicating that
debris trails are a generic feature of short-period comets. By comparison to
orbital calculations for particles of a range of sizes ejected over 2 yr prior
to observation, we find that particles comprising 4 debris trails are typically
mm-sized while the remainder of the debris trails require particles larger than
this. The lower-limit masses of the debris trails are typically 10^11 g, and
the median mass loss rate is 2 kg/s. The mass-loss rate in trail particles is
comparable to that inferred from OH production rates and larger than that
inferred from visible-light scattering in comae.

0705.1060,Obtaining the spacetime metric from cosmological observations,"  Recent galaxy redshift surveys have brought in a large amount of accurate
cosmological data out to redshift 0.3, and future surveys are expected to
achieve a high degree of completeness out to a redshift exceeding 1.
Consequently, a numerical programme for determining the metric of the universe
from observational data will soon become practical; and thereby realise the
ultimate application of Einstein's equations. Apart from detailing the cosmic
geometry, this would allow us to verify and quantify homogeneity, rather than
assuming it, as has been necessary up to now, and to do that on a metric level,
and not merely at the mass distribution level. This paper is the beginning of a
project aimed at such a numerical implementation. The primary observational
data from our past light cone consists of galaxy redshifts, apparent
luminosities, angular diameters and number densities, together with source
evolution functions, absolute luminosities, true diameters and masses of
sources. Here we start with the simplest case, that of spherical symmetry and a
dust equation of state, and execute an algorithm that determines the unknown
metric functions from this data. We discuss the challenges of turning the
theoretical algorithm into a workable numerical procedure, particularly
addressing the origin and the maximum in the area distance. Our numerical
method is tested with several artificial data sets for homogeneous and
inhomogeneous models, successfully reproducing the original models. This
demonstrates the basic viability of such a scheme. Although current surveys
don't have sufficient completeness or accuracy, we expect this situation to
change in the near future, and in the meantime there are many refinements and

  Moreover, the coefficents are calculated explicitly and they turned out to be

unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to

implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an
analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any

algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through
reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some

the b-quark mass can be generated only when the {}^{(d)}T symmetry is broken,
giving a dynamical origin for the hierarchy between m_{b} and m_{t}. There are
only nine operators allowed in the Yukawa sector up to at least mass dimension
seven due to an additional Z_{12} x Z'_{12} symmetry, which also forbids, up to
some high orders, operators that lead to proton decay. The resulting model has
a total of nine parameters in the charged fermion and neutrino sectors, and
hence is very predictive. In addition to the prediction for \theta_{13} \simeq

0705.4277,Convolutions on compact groups and Fourier algebras of coset spaces,"  In this note we study two related questions. (1) For a compact group G, what
are the ranges of the convolution maps on A(GXG) given for u,v in A(G) by $u X
v |-> u*v' ($v'(s)=v(s^{-1})$) and $u X v |-> u*v$? (2) For a locally compact
group G and a compact subgroup K, what are the amenability properties of the
Fourier algebra of the coset space A(G/K)? The algebra A(G/K) was defined and
studied by the first named author.
  In answering the first question, we obtain for compact groups which do not
admit an abelian subgroup of finite index, some new subalgebras of A(G). Using
those algebras we can find many instances in which A(G/K) fails the most
rudimentary amenability property: operator weak amenability. However, using
different techniques, we show that if the connected component of the identity
of G is abelian, then A(G/K) always satisfies the stronger property that it is
hyper-Tauberian, which is a concept developed by the second named author. We

",math.FA,"Convolutions on compact groups and Fourier algebras of coset spaces   In this note we study two related questions. (1) For a compact group G, what
are the ranges of the convolution maps on A(GXG) given for u,v in A(G) by $u X
v |-> u*v' ($v'(s)=v(s^{-1})$) and $u X v |-> u*v$? (2) For a locally compact
group G and a compact subgroup K, what are the amenability properties of the
Fourier algebra of the coset space A(G/K)? The algebra A(G/K) was defined and
studied by the first named author.
  In answering the first question, we obtain for compact groups which do not
admit an abelian subgroup of finite index, some new subalgebras of A(G). Using
those algebras we can find many instances in which A(G/K) fails the most
rudimentary amenability property: operator weak amenability. However, using
different techniques, we show that if the connected component of the identity
of G is abelian, then A(G/K) always satisfies the stronger property that it is
hyper-Tauberian, which is a concept developed by the second named author. We
also establish a criterion which characterises operator amenability of A(G/K)

0704.0316,"The Millennium Galaxy Catalogue: The local supermassive black hole mass
  function in early- and late-type galaxies","  We provide a new estimate of the local supermassive black hole mass function
using (i) the empirical relation between supermassive black hole mass and the
Sersic index of the host spheroidal stellar system and (ii) the measured
(spheroid) Sersic indices drawn from 10k galaxies in the Millennium Galaxy
Catalogue. The observational simplicity of our approach, and the direct
measurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for
both elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it
straightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type
galaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass function
with a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope
(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy
sample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and
integrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local
mass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,
early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type
galaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The
uncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include
uncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the
galaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive
black hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70.

on the temperature and ionisation structure of HII regions, via the
construction of 3D photoionisation models using the 3D Monte Carlo
photoionisation code MOCASSIN. We find that the true temperature fluctuations

HII regions are often used to study the metallicity of star-forming regions. We
compare integrated emission line spectra from our models and quantify any
systematic errors caused by the simplifying assumption of a single, central
location for all ionising sources. We find that the dependence of the
metallicity indicators on the ionisation parameter causes a clear bias, due to
the fact that models with a fully distributed configuration of stars always
display lower ionisation parameters than their fully concentrated counterparts.

0704.0873,Predicting the frequencies of diverse exo-planetary systems,"  Extrasolar planetary systems range from hot Jupiters out to icy comet belts
more distant than Pluto. We explain this diversity in a model where the mass of
solids in the primordial circumstellar disk dictates the outcome. The star
retains measures of the initial heavy-element (metal) abundance that can be
used to map solid masses onto outcomes, and the frequencies of all classes are
correctly predicted. The differing dependences on metallicity for forming
massive planets and low-mass cometary bodies are also explained. By
extrapolation, around two-thirds of stars have enough solids to form Earth-like

",astro-ph,"Predicting the frequencies of diverse exo-planetary systems   Extrasolar planetary systems range from hot Jupiters out to icy comet belts
more distant than Pluto. We explain this diversity in a model where the mass of
solids in the primordial circumstellar disk dictates the outcome. The star
retains measures of the initial heavy-element (metal) abundance that can be
used to map solid masses onto outcomes, and the frequencies of all classes are
correctly predicted. The differing dependences on metallicity for forming
massive planets and low-mass cometary bodies are also explained. By
extrapolation, around two-thirds of stars have enough solids to form Earth-like
planets, and a high rate is supported by the first detections of low-mass

0704.1255,Two-way coupling of FENE dumbbells with a turbulent shear flow,"  We present numerical studies for finitely extensible nonlinear elastic (FENE)
dumbbells which are dispersed in a turbulent plane shear flow at moderate
Reynolds number. The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a
set of stochastic ordinary differential equations with Brownian noise. The
dynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations.
Momentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an
additional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both
components of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way
coupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of
motion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow
for different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by
Weissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in
our study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic
properties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy
budget and the Reynolds stresses. A reduction of the turbulent drag by up to
20% is observed for the larger particle inertia. The angular statistics of the
dumbbells shows an increasing alignment with the mean flow direction for both,
increasing elasticity and inertia. This goes in line with a growing asymmetry
of the probability density function of the transverse derivative of the
streamwise turbulent velocity component. We find that dumbbells get stretched
referentially in regions where vortex stretching or bi-axial strain dominate
the local dynamics and topology of the velocity gradient tensor.

the phase screens are rigidly shifted into a direction imposed by some wind

North 8m telescope. The galaxy lies at a redshift of z = 4.941 making it the
fourth highest spectroscopically identified burst host. However, it is the
second highest redshift galaxy for which the quality of the spectrum permits a

show that the metallicity is in excess of a tenth of solar which is far above
the metallicities in damped Lyman alpha absorbers at high redshift. The
tightest constraint is from the Fe lines which place [Fe/H] in excess of -0.8.
We argue that the results suggest that metallicity bias could be a serious
problem with inferring star formation from the GRB population and consider how

  methods for astronomical data analysis","  In performing a Bayesian analysis of astronomical data, two difficult
problems often emerge. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for

pronounced (curving) degeneracies, which can cause problems for traditional
MCMC sampling methods. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models,
calculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally
expensive. The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling (2004), has
greatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidences and also
produces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been applied
successfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee et al. (2006), but their
implementation was efficient only for unimodal distributions without pronounced
degeneracies. Shaw et al. (2007), recently introduced a clustered nested
sampling method which is significantly more efficient in sampling from
multimodal posteriors and also determines the expectation and variance of the
final evidence from a single run of the algorithm, hence providing a further
increase in efficiency. In this paper, we build on the work of Shaw et al. and
present three new methods for sampling and evidence evaluation from

by other mechanisms from the ones that we believe, are special to our proposal.
We support our claims by presenting some numerical checks performed on the 3d

0705.0475,Production of trans-Neptunian binaries through chaos-assisted capture,"  The recent discovery of binary objects in the Kuiper-belt opens an invaluable
window into past and present conditions in the trans-Neptunian part of the
Solar System. For example, knowledge of how these objects formed can be used to
impose constraints on planetary formation theories. We have recently proposed a
binary-object formation model based on the notion of chaos-assisted capture.
Here we present a more detailed analysis with calculations performed in the
spatial (three-dimensional) three- and four-body Hill approximations. It is
assumed that the potential binary partners are initially following heliocentric
Keplerian orbits and that their relative motion becomes perturbed as these
objects undergo close encounters. First, the mass, velocity, and orbital
element distribu- tions which favour binary formation are identified in the
circular and elliptical Hill limits. We then consider intruder scattering in
the circular Hill four-body problem and find that the chaos-assisted capture
mechanism is consistent with observed, apparently randomly distributed, binary
mutual orbit inclinations. It also predicts asymmetric distributions of
retrograde versus prograde orbits. The time-delay induced by chaos on particle
transport through the Hill sphere is analogous to the formation of a resonance
in a chemical reaction. Implications for binary formation rates are considered
and the 'fine-tuning' problem recently identified by Noll et al. (2007) is also

meta-stable lumps of hot plasma lying in locally un-Higgsed regions of space.
They decay via O(1/N) thermal radiation and, perhaps surprisingly, absorb all
incident matter. We show that an incident particle of energy E striking the
plasma puddle will shower into an enormous number of decay products whose
multiplicity grows linearly with E, and whose average energy is independent of
E. Once these ultra-soft particles reach the interior they are thermalized by
the plasma within, and so the object appears ``black.'' We determine some gross
properties like the size and temperature of the the plasma puddle in terms of
fundamental parameters in the gauge theory. Interestingly, demanding that the
plasma puddle emit thermal Hawking radiation implies that the object is black
(i.e. absorbs all incident particles), which implies classical stability, which
implies satisfaction of the Bekenstein entropy bound. Because of the AdS/CFT
duality and the many similarities between plasma puddles and black holes, we
conjecture that black objects are a robust feature of quantum gravity.

formation and evolution. Here we measure the 3-dimensional motion of the
microquasar GRS 1915+105, using a decade of astrometry with the NRAO Very Long

the Galactic Plane deviates from circular rotation by 53-80 +_ 8 km/s, where
the range covers any specific distance from 6-12 kpc. Perpendicular to the

a distance 9-10 kpc, and is then nearly in the radial direction towards the
Galactic Center. We discuss mechanisms for the origin of the peculiar velocity,
and conclude that it is most likely a consequence of Galactic velocity
diffusion on this old binary, rather than the result of a supernova kick during
the formation of the 14 Mo black hole. Finally, a brief comparison is made with
4 other BH binaries whose kinematics are well determined.

0706.0211,Red Sequence Cluster Finding in the Millennium Simulation,"  We investigate halo mass selection properties of red-sequence cluster finders
using galaxy populations of the Millennium Simulation (MS). A clear red
sequence exists for MS galaxies in massive halos at redshifts z < 1, and we use
this knowledge to inform a cluster-finding algorithm applied to 500 Mpc/h
projections of the simulated volume. At low redshift (z=0.4), we find that 90%
of the clusters found have galaxy membership dominated by a single, real-space
halo, and that 10% are blended systems for which no single halo contributes a
majority of a cluster's membership. At z=1, the fraction of blends increases to
22%, as weaker redshift evolution in observed color extends the comoving length
probed by a fixed range of color. Other factors contributing to the increased
blending at high-z include broadening of the red sequence and confusion from a
larger number of intermediate mass halos hosting bright red galaxies of
magnitude similar to those in higher mass halos. Our method produces catalogs
of cluster candidates whose halo mass selection function, p(M|\Ngal,z), is
characterized by a bimodal log-normal model with a dominant component that
reproduces well the real-space distribution, and a redshift-dependent tail that
is broader and displaced by a factor ~2 lower in mass. We discuss implications

  By related estimates, we show that unstable eigenvalues are confined to a

independent of amplitude and the adiabatic constant $\gamma$. We complete our

0704.2418,"Adding Environmental Gas Physics to the Semi-Analytic Method for Galaxy
  Formation: Gravitational Heating","  We present results of an attempt to include more detailed gas physics
motivated from hydrodynamical simulations within semi-analytic models (SAM) of
galaxy formation, focusing on the role that environmental effects play. The
main difference to previous SAMs is that we include 'gravitational' heating of
the intra-cluster medium (ICM) by the net surplus of gravitational potential
energy released from gas that has been stripped from infalling satellites.
Gravitational heating appears to be an efficient heating source able to prevent
cooling in environments corresponding to dark matter halos more massive than
$\sim 10^{13} $M$_{\odot}$. The energy release by gravitational heating can
match that by AGN-feedback in massive galaxies and can exceed it in the most
massive ones. However, there is a fundamental difference in the way the two
processes operate. Gravitational heating becomes important at late times, when
the peak activity of AGNs is already over, and it is very mass dependent. This
mass dependency and time behaviour gives the right trend to recover down-sizing

massive dark matter halo at high redshifts. We show how high-density, compact
stellar systems are formed from GMCs influenced both by physical processes
associated with star formation and by tidal fields of their host halos. We also
show that chemical pollution of GC-forming GMCs by stellar winds from massive
stars can result in star-to-star abundance inhomogeneities among light elements
(e.g., C, N, and O) of stars in GCs. The present model with a canonical initial
mass function (IMF) also shows a C-N anticorrelation that stars with smaller

``self-pollution'' of GC-forming GMCs by stellar winds from massive stars can
cause abundance inhomogeneities of GCs, the present models with different

  high-luminosity quasars","  It has been shown that the luminosity of AGNs and the size of their broad
line region obey a simple relation of the type R=a L^g, from faint Seyfert
nuclei to bright quasars, allowing single-epoch determination of the central
black hole mass M=b L^g D^2 from their luminosity L and width of H_beta
emission line. Adopting this mass determination for cosmological studies
requires the extrapolation to high z and L of a relation whose calibration
relies so far on reverberation mapping measurements performed for L<10^46 erg/s

intermediate z quasars whose apparent magnitude V<15.7 allows observations with
a 1.8m telescope, aimed at proving that emission lines vary and respond to
continuum variations even for luminosities >10^47 erg/s, and determining
eventually their M_BH from reverberation mapping. We have repeatedly performed
simultaneous observations of quasars and reference stars to determine relative
variability of continuum and emission lines. We describe the observations and
methods of analysis. For the quasars PG1634+706 and PG1247+268 we obtain
light-curves respectively for CIII], MgII and for CIV, CIII] emission lines

no continuum variability has been detected and the evidence for line
variability is marginal, while in the latter case both continuum and line
variability are detected with high significance and the line variations appear
correlated with continuum variations. The detection of the emission line

0706.0500,A deeper search for the progenitor of the Type Ic Supernova 2002ap,"  (Abridged) We present a search for the progenitor star of the Type Ic
Supernova 2002ap in deep, high quality pre-explosion observations taken with
the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). Aligning high-resolution Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) observations of the supernova itself with the archival
CFHT images allowed us to pinpoint the location of the progenitor site on the
ground based observations. We find that a source visible in the B and R band
pre-explosion images close to the position of the SN is (1) not coincident with
the SN position within the uncertainties of our relative astrometry, and (2) is
still visible ~ 4.7 yrs post-explosion in late-time observations taken with the
William Herschel Telescope. We therefore conclude that it is not the progenitor
of SN 2002ap. Comparing our luminosity limits with stellar models of single
stars at appropriate metallicity (Z=0.008) we conclude that any single star
progenitor must have experienced at least twice the standard mass loss rates
during pre-Wolf-Rayet evolution, been initially > 30-40M(Sun) and exploded as a
Wolf-Rayet star of final mass 10-12M(Sun). Alternatively an initially less
massive progenitor may have evolved in an interacting binary system. We
constrain any possible binary companion to a main sequence star of < 20M(Sun),
a neutron star or a black hole. By combining the pre-explosion limits with the
ejecta mass estimates and constraints from X-ray and radio observations we
conclude that any binary interaction most likely occurred as Case B mass
transfer, either with or without a subsequent common envelope evolution phase.

the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). Aligning high-resolution Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) observations of the supernova itself with the archival
CFHT images allowed us to pinpoint the location of the progenitor site on the
ground based observations. We find that a source visible in the B and R band
pre-explosion images close to the position of the SN is (1) not coincident with
the SN position within the uncertainties of our relative astrometry, and (2) is
still visible ~ 4.7 yrs post-explosion in late-time observations taken with the
William Herschel Telescope. We therefore conclude that it is not the progenitor
of SN 2002ap. Comparing our luminosity limits with stellar models of single
stars at appropriate metallicity (Z=0.008) we conclude that any single star
progenitor must have experienced at least twice the standard mass loss rates
during pre-Wolf-Rayet evolution, been initially > 30-40M(Sun) and exploded as a
Wolf-Rayet star of final mass 10-12M(Sun). Alternatively an initially less
massive progenitor may have evolved in an interacting binary system. We
constrain any possible binary companion to a main sequence star of < 20M(Sun),
a neutron star or a black hole. By combining the pre-explosion limits with the
ejecta mass estimates and constraints from X-ray and radio observations we
conclude that any binary interaction most likely occurred as Case B mass
transfer, either with or without a subsequent common envelope evolution phase.

0705.1756,On Einstein clusters as galactic dark matter halos,"  We consider global and gravitational lensing properties of the recently
suggested Einstein clusters of WIMPs as galactic dark matter halos. Being
tangential pressure dominated, Einstein clusters are strongly anisotropic
systems which can describe any galactic rotation curve by specifying the
anisotropy. Due to this property, Einstein clusters may be considered as dark
matter candidates. We analyse the stability of the Einstein clusters against
both radial and non-radial pulsations, and we show that the Einstein clusters
are dynamically stable. With the use of the Buchdahl type inequalities for
anisotropic bodies, we derive upper limits on the velocity of the particles
defining the cluster. These limits are consistent with those obtained from
stability considerations. The study of light deflection shows that the
gravitational lensing effect is slightly smaller for the Einstein clusters, as
compared to the singular isothermal density sphere model for dark matter.
Therefore lensing observations may discriminate, at least in principle, between
Einstein cluster and other dark matter models.

object appears in three-dimensional space. From an observational point of view
this may give us a misleading picture. The faint stars may be the most common
stars in the system but the morphological information obtained by observations
of an object may be dominated by the color properties of the bright stars. Due
to dynamical effects, such as energy equipartition, different masses of stars
may populate different regions in the object. Since stars are evolving in mass
the stellar evolution may also influence the dynamics of the system. Hence, if
one is interested in simulating what the morphology will look like through a
telescope, one needs to simulate in addition evolving stars and weight them by
their luminosity. Therefore we need to combine simulations of the dynamical
evolution and a stellar population synthesis at the same time. For the
dynamical evolution part we use a parallel version of a direct N-body code,
NBODY6++. This code also includes stellar evolution. We link the parameters
from this stellar evolution routine to the BaSeL 2.0 stellar library. For
isolated clusters we found results assimilable to standard stellar population

that the integrated colors become relatively bluer due to energy equipartition

0705.1377,Dynamic Screening in a Two-Species Asymmetric Exclusion Process,"  The dynamic scaling properties of the one dimensional Burgers equation are

both mass and momentum. The most elementary version of this is the
Arndt-Heinzel-Rittenberg (AHR) process, which is usually presented as a two
species diffusion process, with particles of opposite charge hopping in
opposite directions and with a variable passing probability.
  From the hydrodynamics perspective this can be viewed as two coupled Burgers
equations, with the number of positive and negative momentum quanta
individually conserved. We determine the dynamic scaling dimension of the AHR
process from the time evolution of the two-point correlation functions, and
find numerically that the dynamic critical exponent is consistent with simple
Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) type scaling. We establish that this is the result of
perfect screening of fluctuations in the stationary state. The two-point
correlations decay exponentially in our simulations and in such a manner that
in terms of quasi-particles, fluctuations fully screen each other at coarse
grained length scales. We prove this screening rigorously using the analytic
matrix product structure of the stationary state. The proof suggests the
existence of a topological invariant. The process remains in the KPZ
universality class but only in the sense of a factorization, as $({KPZ})^2$.

0704.0441,Evidence for a planetary companion around a nearby young star,"  We report evidence for a planetary companion around the nearby young star HD
70573. The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age
estimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observations
of this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our
spectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about
100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored
since December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within
this period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a
period of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of
this variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3
days. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff
variation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation
between the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the
rotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the
long-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass
companion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial
velocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host
star, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which
lies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.
The orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery
around the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debris
disks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.

electrically neutral mass $m_m$ in the middle, whereas the star bears a charge
$Q_s$ ($Q_o$ and $Q_s$ have the same sign, $Q_i$ the opposite one). The

based on a formal solution of the stress transport equation in which the
production terms can be integrated exactly in terms of matrix exponentials.
This formal solution of the subgrid-scale stress transport equation is shown to
be useful to explore special cases, such as the response to constant velocity
gradient, but neglecting pressure-strain correlations and diffusion effects.
The second approach is based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian change of variables,
combined with the assumption of isotropy for the conditionally averaged
Lagrangian velocity gradient tensor and with the `Recent Fluid Deformation'
(RFD) approximation. It is shown that both approaches lead to the same basic
closure in which the stress tensor is expressed as the product of the matrix
exponential of the resolved velocity gradient tensor multiplied by its
transpose. Short-time expansions of the matrix exponentials are shown to
provide an eddy-viscosity term and particular quadratic terms, and thus allow a
reinterpretation of traditional eddy-viscosity and nonlinear stress closures.
The basic feasibility of the matrix-exponential closure is illustrated by
implementing it successfully in Large Eddy Simulation of forced isotropic
turbulence. The matrix-exponential closure employs the drastic approximation of
entirely omitting the pressure-strain correlation and other `nonlinear
scrambling' terms. But unlike eddy-viscosity closures, the matrix exponential

hidden sector gauge theory should be around the messenger mass scale M, or
otherwise perturbative calculations would be reliable and would lead to
negative soft mass squared for squarks and sleptons. Thus, all the mass scales
are controlled by a virtually single parameter, \sqrt{D}/M. This model covers a
very wide range of gravitino mass, m_{3/2} \simeq 1 eV--100 TeV. Possible
embeddings of the model in string theory are also discussed.

solar corona so as to create solar explosions such as solar flares and coronal
mass ejections (CMEs). Recent studies have confirmed that a system consisting
of a flux rope embedded in a background field exhibits a catastrophic behavior,
and the energy threshold at the catastrophic point may exceed the associated
open field energy. The accumulated free energy in the corona is abruptly
released when the catastrophe takes place, and it probably serves as the main
means of energy release for CMEs at least in the initial phase. Such a release
proceeds via an ideal MHD process in contrast with nonideal ones such as
magnetic reconnection. The catastrophe results in a sudden formation of
electric current sheets, which naturally provide proper sites for fast magnetic
reconnection. The reconnection may be identified with a solar flare associated
with the CME on one hand, and produces a further acceleration of the CME on the
other. On this basis, several preliminary suggestions are made for future
observational investigations, especially with the proposed KuaFu satellites, on

nonlinear absorber and external force, separately. It was found that
self-organization occurs through the Hopf bifurcation and results to a stable
pulse radiation. Analysis is performed according to the Floquet exponent
investigation. It was found that influence of the nonlinear absorber extends
the domain of control parameters that manage a stable periodic radiation
processes. An external force suppresses self-organization processes. A combined
influence of both external force and nonlinear absorber results to more
complicated picture of self-organization with two reentrant Hopf bifurcations.

interband absorption is thoroughly studied which shows the importance of
surface polarization effects that significantly reduce the absorption when
included. This reduction is found to increase with decreasing NC size or with
increasing permittivity mismatch between the NC core and the host matrix.

available. The deformation of spherical NCs into prolate or oblate ellipsoids
are seen to introduce no pronounced effects for the absorption spectra. Next,

magnetohydrodynamic load and magnetohydrodynamic metage in the case of

0704.1278,Turbulent Mixing in the Surface Layers of Accreting Neutron Stars,"  During accretion a neutron star (NS) is spun up as angular momentum is
transported through its surface layers. We study the resulting differentially
rotating profile, focusing on the impact this has for type I X-ray bursts. The
predominant viscosity is likely provided by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. The
radial and azimuthal magnetic field components have strengths of ~10^5 G and
~10^10 G, respectively. This leads to nearly uniform rotation at the depths of
interest for X-ray bursts. A remaining small shear transmits the accreted
angular momentum inward to the NS interior. Though this shear gives little
viscous heating, it can trigger turbulent mixing. Detailed simulations will be
required to fully understand the consequences of mixing, but our models
illustrate some general features. Mixing has the greatest impact when the
buoyancy at the compositional discontinuity between accreted matter and ashes
is overcome. This occurs at high accretion rates, at low spin frequencies, or
may depend on the ashes from the previous burst. We then find two new regimes
of burning. The first is ignition in a layer containing a mixture of heavier
elements from the ashes. If ignition occurs at the base of the mixed layer,
recurrence times as short as ~5-30 minutes are possible. This may explain the
short recurrence time of some bursts, but incomplete burning is still needed to
explain these bursts' energetics. When mixing is sufficiently strong, a second
regime is found where accreted helium mixes deep enough to burn stably,
quenching X-ray bursts. We speculate that the observed change in X-ray burst
properties near one-tenth the Eddington accretion rate is from this mechanism.
The carbon-rich material produced by stable helium burning would be important
for triggering and fueling superbursts. (abridged)

solid-state lasers is presented, with a special focus on diode-pumped
ytterbium-doped materials. A large part of this review provides however general
information applicable to any kind of solid-state laser. Our aim here is not to
make a list of the techniques that have been used to minimize thermal effects,
but instead to give an overview of the theoretical aspects underneath, and give
a state-of-the-art of the tools at the disposal of the laser scientist to
measure thermal effects. After a presentation of some general properties of
Yb-doped materials, we address the issue of evaluating the temperature map in
Yb-doped laser crystals, both theoretically and experimentally. This is the
first step before studying the complex problem of thermal lensing (part III).
We will focus on some newly discussed aspects, like the definition of the
thermo-optic coefficient: we will highlight some misleading interpretations of
thermal lensing experiments due to the use of the dn/dT parameter in a context
where it is not relevant. Part IV will be devoted to a state-of-the-art of
experimental techniques used to measure thermal lensing. Eventually, in part V,
we will give some concrete examples in Yb-doped materials, where their
peculiarities will be pointed out.

trivially on $\C^*$). Groups of central type play a fundamental role in the
classification of semisimple triangular complex Hopf algebras and can be
determined by their representation theoretical properties.
  Suppose that a finite group $Q$ acts on an abelian group $A$ so that there
exists a bijective 1-cocycle $\pi\in Z^1(Q,\ach)$, where
$\ach=\rm{Hom}(A,\C^*)$ is endowed with the diagonal $Q$-action. Under this

2-cocycle in $Z^2(G,\C^*)$, where $G:=A\rtimes Q$. Hence, the semidirect

  In this paper we present a more general correspondence between bijective and

0704.3001,"Multidimensional supernova simulations with approximative neutrino
  transport. II. Convection and the advective-acoustic cycle in the supernova
  core","  By 2D hydrodynamic simulations including a detailed equation of state and
neutrino transport, we investigate the interplay between different non-radial
hydrodynamic instabilities that play a role during the postbounce accretion
phase of collapsing stellar cores. The convective mode of instability, which is
driven by negative entropy gradients caused by neutrino heating or by time
variations of the shock strength, can be identified clearly by the development
of typical Rayleigh-Taylor mushrooms. However, in cases where the gas in the
postshock region is rapidly advected towards the gain radius, the growth of
such a buoyancy instability can be suppressed. In such a situation the shocked
flow nevertheless can develop non-radial asymmetry with an oscillatory growth
of the amplitude. This phenomenon has been termed ``standing accretion shock
instability'' (SASI). It is shown here that the SASI oscillations can trigger
convective instability and like the latter they lead to an increase of the
average shock radius and of the mass in the gain layer. Both hydrodynamic
instabilities in combination stretch the advection time of matter through the
neutrino-heating layer and thus enhance the neutrino energy deposition in
support of the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. A rapidly contracting and
more compact nascent NS turns out to be favorable for explosions, because the
accretion luminosity and neutrino heating are larger and the growth rate of the
SASI is higher. Moreover, we show that the oscillation period of the SASI and a
variety of other features in our simulations agree with estimates for the

this series by considering the stability properties of longitudinal flows along
magnetic flux tubes. A linear stability analysis was carried out to determine
criteria for the onset of instability in the framework of the approximation of
thin magnetic flux tubes. In the non-dissipative case, we find Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability for flow velocities exceeding a critical speed that depends on the
Alfv{\'e}n speed and on the ratio of the internal and external densities.
Inclusion of a friction term proportional to the relative transverse velocity
leads to a friction-driven instability connected with backward (or negative
energy) waves. We discuss the physical nature of this instability. In the case
of a stratified external medium, the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the
friction-driven instability can set in for flow speeds significantly lower than
the Alfv{\'e}n speed. Dissipative effects can excite flow-driven instability
below the thresholds for the Kelvin-Helmholtz and the undulatory (Parker-type)

state of the quantum electromagnetic field in terms of its Bures distance to

was considerably simplified by using the remarkable properties of the Uhlmann
fidelity as well as the standard form II of the covariance matrix of a

the Bures distance depends only on the smallest symplectic eigenvalue of the
covariance matrix of the partially transposed density operator. It is thus
consistent to the exact expression of the entanglement of formation for
symmetric two-mode Gaussian states. This non-trivial agreement is specific to

from a previously-reported magnetocurrent ratio of ~2% to ~35% and an estimated

perturbation on large scales represents an alternative to the standard

due to fluctuations of the inflaton field itself. Its basic assumption is that
the initial curvature perturbation due to the inflaton field is negligible.
This is attained by lowering the energy scale of inflation, thereby highly

compute the power-spectrum of the gravitational waves generated at second order
in perturbation theory by the curvaton (isocurvature) perturbations between the
end of inflation and the curvaton decay. An interesting property of this

generate possible signal scenarios. Signals could be observed with an
integrated luminosity of 30 fb^{-1}. Secondly a search for the technirho,

  Question","  Prochter et al. 2006 recently found that the number density of strong
intervening 0.5<z<2 MgII absorbers detected in gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow
spectra is nearly 4 times larger than in QSO spectra. We have conducted a
similar study using CIV absorbers. Our CIV sample, consisting of a total of 20
systems, is drawn from 3 high resolution and high to moderate S/N VLT/UVES

show any statistical difference with the same quantities measured in QSO

MgII absorbers and conclude that a higher dust extinction in the MgII QSO
samples studied up to now would give the most straightforward solution.
However, this effect is only important for the strong MgII absorbers.
Regardless of the reasons for this discrepancy, this result confirms once more
that GRBs can be used to detect a side of the universe that was unknown before,
not necessarily connected with GRBs themselves, providing an alternative and

these bounds are relaxed for small values of A_t and large values of the

dynamically cold, flattened, disk-like structures that could not have formed
via violent relaxation. Therefore thee question is whether at types Sa-Sbc,
where both bulge types are found, the red-blue dichotomy separates galaxies at
some value of disk-to-bulge ratio, $B/T$, or, whether it separates galaxies of
different bulge type, irrespective of their $B/T$. We identify classical bulges

galaxies. Detailed surface photometry reveals that: (1) The red -- blue
dichotomy is a function of bulge type: at the same $B/T$, pseudobulges are in
globally blue galaxies and classical bulges are in globally red galaxies. (2)

experimental data for the branching ratios for $\bar{B}^0 \to\rho^0\rho^0$ and
$\bar{B}^0 \to\rho^+\rho^-$. We find that the CP violating asymmetry could be
very large (even more than 90% for some values of $N_c$). It is shown that the
sensitivity of the CP violating asymmetry to $N_c$ is large compared with its
smaller sensitivity to the CKM matrix elements. We also discuss the possibility
to remove the mod $(\pi)$ ambiguity in the determination of the CP violating
phase angle $\alpha$ through the measurement of the CP violating asymmetry in
the decay $\bar{B}^0\to \rho^0(\omega)\rho^0(\omega) \to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$.

Previous treatments of such models do not include a realistic embedding of

through a strong push or ""kick"" of the inflaton, and sufficient reheating can
be achieved depending on model parameters. This allows us to explore both

into active (blue) and quiescent (red) galaxies. Our measurements of the K-LFs
and LD evolution support the idea that a large fraction of galaxies is already

mass-to-light ratio (in K-band) for the spectroscopic sub-sample, we derive the
stellar mass density for the entire sample. We find that the global evolution
of the stellar mass density is well reproduced by the star formation rate
derived from UV dust corrected measurements. Over the last 8Gyrs, we observe
that the stellar mass density of the active population remains approximately
constant while it gradually increases for the quiescent population over the
same timescale. As a consequence, the growth of the stellar mass in the
quiescent population must be due to the shutoff of star formation in active
galaxies that migrate into the quiescent population. From $z=2$ to $z=1.2$, we
observe a major build-up of the quiescent population with an increase by a
factor of 10 in stellar mass, suggesting that we are observing the epoch when

assembled at $z\sim 1.2$. Based on the analysis of the evolution of the stellar
mass-to-light ratio (in K-band) for the spectroscopic sub-sample, we derive the
stellar mass density for the entire sample. We find that the global evolution
of the stellar mass density is well reproduced by the star formation rate
derived from UV dust corrected measurements. Over the last 8Gyrs, we observe
that the stellar mass density of the active population remains approximately
constant while it gradually increases for the quiescent population over the
same timescale. As a consequence, the growth of the stellar mass in the
quiescent population must be due to the shutoff of star formation in active
galaxies that migrate into the quiescent population. From $z=2$ to $z=1.2$, we
observe a major build-up of the quiescent population with an increase by a
factor of 10 in stellar mass, suggesting that we are observing the epoch when
an increasing fraction of galaxies are ending their star formation activity and
start to build up the red sequence.

propagates freely, and this makes it possible to analyze the walks in terms of
scattering theory. The probability of entering a graph from one tail and
leaving from another can be found from the scattering matrix of the graph. We
show how the scattering matrix of a graph that is an automorphic image of the

how the scattering matrix of the reverse graph is related to that of the
original graph. Modifications of graphs and the effects of these modifications
are then considered. In particular we show how the scattering matrix of a graph
is changed if we remove two tails and replace them with an edge or cut an edge
and add two tails. This allows us to combine graphs, that is if we connect two
graphs we can construct the scattering matrix of the combined graph from those

subcomponents we study the largest component for
$\lambda_n=\frac{1+\chi_n}{n}$, where $\epsilon\ge \chi_n\ge n^{-{1/3}+
\delta}$, $\delta>0$. We prove that there exists a.s. a unique largest
component $C_n^{(1)}$. We furthermore show that $\chi_n=\epsilon$, $|
C_n^{(1)}|\sim \alpha(\epsilon) \frac{1+\chi_n}{n} 2^n$ and for $o(1)=\chi_n\ge
n^{-{1/3}+\delta}$, $| C_n^{(1)}| \sim 2 \chi_n \frac{1+\chi_n}{n} 2^n$ holds.
This improves the result of \cite{Bollobas:91} where constant $\chi_n=\chi$ is

and this result does not change with the Mach number either. In contrast to $v$
which exhibits different scaling parallel and perpendicular to the local

predictions. This hierarchy can be related ubiquitous small ionized and neutral

stocks in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India are analyzed in this

The eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, $\mathbf{C}$, of
NSE is found to be similar to that of developed markets, such as the New York

expected for a random matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time
series. Of the few largest eigenvalues that deviate from the bulk, the largest
is identified with market-wide movements. The intermediate eigenvalues that
occur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with
specific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions. However, in the

much closer to the bulk. We propose that this is because of the relative lack

0704.2865,Classical and quantum randomness and the financial market,"  We analyze complexity of financial (and general economic) processes by
comparing classical and quantum-like models for randomness. Our analysis
implies that it might be that a quantum-like probabilistic description is more
natural for financial market than the classical one. A part of our analysis is
devoted to study the possibility of application of the quantum probabilistic
model to agents of financial market. We show that, although the direct quantum
(physical) reduction (based on using the scales of quantum mechanics) is
meaningless, one may apply so called quantum-like models. In our approach
quantum-like probabilistic behaviour is a consequence of contextualy of
statistical data in finances (and economics in general). However, our
hypothesis on ""quantumness"" of financial data should be tested experimentally
(as opposed to the conventional description based on the noncontextual
classical probabilistic approach). We present a new statistical test based on a
generalization of the well known in quantum physics Bell's inequality.

vacancy defects in metals and semiconductors. The main emphasis is on the
energetics of the trapping process including the interplay between the positron
state and the defect's ionic structure and on the ensuing annihilation
characteristics of the trapped state. For vacancies in covalent semiconductors
the ion relaxation is a crucial part of the positron trapping process enabling
the localization of the positron state. However, positron trapping does not
strongly affect the characteristic features of the electronic structure, e.g.,
the ionization levels change only moderately. Also in the case of metal
vacancies the positron-induced ion relaxation has a noticeable effect on the
calculated positron lifetime and momentum distribution of annihilating
electron-positron pairs.

all of whose states have entropy of entanglement at least log d - O(1). It is
also related to results due to Parthasarathy on the dimension of completely
entangled subspaces, which have connections with the construction of
unextendible product bases. Here we take as entanglement measure the Schmidt
rank, and determine, for every pair of local dimensions dA and dB, and every r,
the largest dimension of a subspace consisting only of entangled states of
Schmidt rank r or larger. This exact answer is a significant improvement on the
best bounds that can be obtained using random subspace techniques. We also
determine the converse: the largest dimension of a subspace with an upper bound
on the Schmidt rank. Finally, we discuss the question of subspaces containing
only states with Schmidt equal to r.

substantiate our construction of potential systems. The simplest potential
symmetries of the linear heat equation, which are associated with single
conservation laws, are classified with respect to its point symmetry group.
Equations possessing infinite series of potential symmetry algebras are studied

0706.0517,"TeV gamma-rays from photo-disintegration/de-excitation of nuclei in
  Westerlund 2","  TeV gamma-rays can result from the photo-de-excitation of PeV cosmic ray
nuclei after their parents have undergone photo-disintegration in an
environment of ultraviolet photons. This process is proposed as a candidate
explanation of the recently discovered HESS source at the edge of Westerlund 2.
The UV background is provided by Lyman-alpha emission within the rich O and B
stellar environment. The HESS flux results if there is efficient acceleration
at the source of lower energy nuclei. The requirement that the Lorentz-boosted
ultraviolet photons reach the Giant Dipole resonant energy (~ 20 MeV) implies a
strong suppression of the gamma-ray spectrum compared to an E_\gamma^{-2}
behavior at energies below about 1 TeV. This suppression is not apparent in the
lowest-energy Westerlund 2 datum, but will be probed by the upcoming GLAST
mission.

relations, the Weyl algebra, frequently causes difficulties in applications
since it neither admits the formulation of physically interesting dynamical
laws nor does it incorporate pertinent physical observables such as (bounded

commutation relations is presented which does not suffer from such problems. It
is based on the resolvents of the canonical operators and their algebraic
relations. The resulting C*-algebra, the resolvent algebra, is shown to have
many desirable analytic properties and the regularity structure of its
representations is surprisingly simple. Moreover, the resolvent algebra is a
convenient framework for applications to interacting and to constrained quantum
systems, as we demonstrate by several examples.

intermediate energy sector remains an open question and, if it exists, it is
likely to be originated from the magnetic moment transition from active to
light sterile neutrinos at times of intense solar activity and magnetic field.
We examine the prospects for the SNO+ experiment to address this important
issue and to distinguish between the two classes of solar models which are
currently identified as corresponding to a high (SSM I) and a low (SSM II)
heavy element abundance. We also evaluate the predictions from these two models
for the Chlorine experiment event rate in the standard LMA and LMA+Spin Flavour
Precession (SFP) scenarios. It is found that after three years of SNO+ data
taking, the pep flux measurement will be able to discriminate between the
standard LMA and LMA+SFP scenarios, independently of which is the correct solar
model. If the LMA rate is measured, SFP with $B_0 \sim 280kG$ for the resonant
$\Delta m^2_{01}$ can be excluded at more than $4\sigma$. A low rate would
signal new physics, excluding all the 90% allowed range of the standard LMA
solution at 3$\sigma$, and a time variability would be a strong signature of
the SFP model. The CNO fluxes are the ones for which the two SSM predictions
exhibit the largest differences, so their measurement at SNO+ will be important
to favour one or the other. The distinction will be clearer after LMA or SFP
are confirmed with pep, but still, a CNO measurement at the level of SSM I/LMA
will disfavour SSM II at about $3 \sigma$. We conclude that consistency between
future pep and CNO flux measurements at SNO+ and Chlorine would either favour

AM0707-273, AM1211-465, and AM2040-674. All six galaxies were previously
classified as HII galaxies based on optical and IR spectroscopic analysis. All
galaxies were detected with XMM-Newton and each member was isolated and
analyzed independently. The X-ray spectra reveal strong evidence of AGN
activity in the NE member of AM1211-465 pair. We measured a luminosity of
1.94(+0.11/-0.15)x10^42 erg/s in the 2-10 keV band and the presence of a
neutral FeK_alpha line with a confidence level of 98.8%. The high nH value,
2.2+/-0.2x10^22 cm^-2, would explain the misclassification of the source.
Marginal evidence of AGN nature was found in the X-ray spectra of AM1211-465SW
and AM0707-273E. The X-ray emission of the three remaining galaxies can be
explained by starburst activity.

However, in a recent paper, Mao et al. point out that there is a class of

a significant amount of torsion. They argue that by the principle of action
equals reaction, one would expect the angular momentum of test bodies to couple
to a background torsion field, and therefore the precession of the GPB
gyroscopes should be affected in these theories by the torsion generated by the
Earth. We show that in fact the principle of action equals reaction does not

using the standard histogram method, a remarkable improvement is observed,
especially in far lateral regions of the PDF, where low probability events give

properties of non-Abelian systems. These issues arise in condensed matter
physics in the context of transport of spins in the presence of spin orbit
coupling: the Pauli Hamiltonian governing the leading relativistic corrections
in condensed matter systems can be rewritten in a language of SU(2) covariant
derivatives, where the role of the non-Abelian gauge fields is taken by the
physical electromagnetic fields. Taking a similar perspective as Jackiw and
coworkers, we show that non-abelian hydrodynamical currents can be factored in
a non-coherent 'classical' part, and a coherent part requiring macroscopic
non-abelian quantum entanglement. Non-abelian flow being thus a much richer
affair than familiar hydrodynamics, permits us to classify the various spin
transport phenomena in in condensed matter physics in a unifying framework.In
semiconductor spintronics, the absence of hydrodynamics is well known, but in
our formulation it is directly associated with the fact that non-abelian

single particle currents of relevance to mesoscopic transport with as highlight
the Aharonov-Casher effect, where we demonstrate that the non-abelian transport

0704.2110,Stability of the superconducting state in YBa_2Cu_3O_7,"  The nonadiabatic Heisenberg model (NHM) proposed as an extension of the
Heisenberg model makes a contribution to the eigenstate problem of
superconductivity. The Hamiltonian H^n derived within this group-theoretical
model has superconducting eigenstates if and only if the considered material
possesses a narrow, roughly half-filled ""superconducting"" energy band of
special symmetry in its band structure. This paper shows that the
high-temperature superconductor YBa_2Cu_3O_7 possesses such a superconducting
band. This new result together with previous observations about other
superconductors and non-superconductors corroborates the theoretical evidence
within the NHM that stable superconducting states are connected with
superconducting bands. It is proposed that the type of superconductivity, i.e.,
whether the material is a conventional low-T_c or a high-T_c superconductor, is
determined by the energetically lowest boson excitations that carry the crystal
spin 1*hbar and are sufficiently stable to transport this crystal spin-angular
momentum through the crystal. This mechanism provides the electron-phonon
mechanism that enters the BCS theory in conventional superconductors.

accuracy for speed, i.e. it works faster than a full search. Partial search
algorithm was discovered by Grover and Radhakrishnan. We shall consider
optimized version of the algorithm and call it GRK. It can be applied
successively [in a sequence]. First the database is partitioned into blocks and
we use GRK to find the target block. Then this target block is partitioned into
sub-blocks and we use GRK again to find the target sub-block. [We can call it

optimized version of the algorithm and call it GRK. It can be applied
successively [in a sequence]. First the database is partitioned into blocks and
we use GRK to find the target block. Then this target block is partitioned into
sub-blocks and we use GRK again to find the target sub-block. [We can call it
binary quantum search.] Another possibility is to partition the database into
sub-blocks directly and use GRK to find the target sub-block in one time. In
this paper we prove that the latter is faster [makes less queries to the
oracle].

in spatially-complex environments. We introduce a class of stochastic models

kernel: when w changes rapidly compared to this width, u* ~ w, whereas on
global scales large compared to this width, u* ~ w^2. We analyse the behavior
at discontinuities in w which occur at habitat type boundaries. We simulate the
dynamics of space use given two-dimensional prey-availability data and explore
the effect of the redistribution kernel width. Our factorization allows such
numerical simulations to be done extremely fast; we expect this to aid the

equation operator and $g(\omega)$ is a number called the geometrical quantity
of $\omega$ and defined as follows. A ray in $\Omega$ is the trajectory
generated by the free motion of a mass-point in $\Omega$ subject to elastic
reflections on the boundary. These reflections obey the law of geometrical

on a subset $\omega\subset \Omega$ decays exponentially in time as soon as
$\omega$ satisfies a geometrical condition known as the ""Bardos-Lebeau-Rauch""
condition. The rate $\tau(\omega)$ of this decay satisfies $\tau(\omega)= 2
\min(-\mu(\omega), g(\omega))$ (see Lebeau [Math. Phys. Stud. 19 (1996)
73-109]). Here $\mu(\omega)$ denotes the spectral abscissa of the damped wave
equation operator and $g(\omega)$ is a number called the geometrical quantity
of $\omega$ and defined as follows. A ray in $\Omega$ is the trajectory
generated by the free motion of a mass-point in $\Omega$ subject to elastic
reflections on the boundary. These reflections obey the law of geometrical
optics. The geometrical quantity $g(\omega)$ is then defined as the upper limit
(large time asymptotics) of the average trajectory length. We give here an
algorithm to compute explicitly $g(\omega)$ when $\omega$ is a finite union of

black rings by demanding the radiation to eliminate the possible anomalies on
the horizons. It is shown that the temperature, energy flux and

black rings considered in this paper contain the Myers-Perry black hole as a

Hawking radiation can be regarded as the anomaly eliminator on horizons and
suggest its general applicability to the higher-dimensional black holes

future space-borne gravitational wave detectors, such as the Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). These events are characterized by
long-period, nearly-radial orbits of compact objects around a central massive
black hole. The gravitational radiation emitted during such events consists of
a short burst, corresponding to periapse passage, followed by a longer, silent
interval. In this paper we investigate the impact of including relativistic
corrections to the description of the compact object's trajectory via a
geodesic treatment, as well as including higher-order multipole corrections in
the waveform calculation. The degree to which the relativistic corrections are
important depends on the EMRB's orbital parameters. We find that relativistic
EMRBs (v_{max}}/c > 0.25) are not rare and actually account for approximately
half of the events in our astrophysical model. The relativistic corrections
tend to significantly change the waveform amplitude and phase relative to a
Newtonian description, although some of this dephasing could be mimicked by
parameter errors. The dephasing over several bursts could be of particular
importance not only to gravitational wave detection, but also to parameter
estimation, since it is highly correlated to the spin of the massive black
hole. Consequently, we postulate that if a relativistic EMRB is detected, such
dephasing might be used to probe the relativistic character of the massive
black hole and obtain information about its spin.

  Sensitivity of Stellar Evolution Models","  Integrated light from distant galaxies is often compared to stellar
population models via the equivalent widths of spectral features--spectral

comparisons hinge not only on the overall metal abundance but also on relative

synthetic spectra but little has been done to address similar issues in the
stellar evolution models that underlie most stellar population models. Stellar
evolution models will primarily be influenced by changes in opacities. In order
to explore this issue in detail, twelve sets of stellar evolution tracks and
isochrones have been created at constant heavy element mass fraction Z that
self-consistently account for varying heavy element mixtures. These sets
include scaled-solar, alpha-enhanced, and individual cases where the elements
C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, and Fe have been enhanced above their
scaled-solar values. The variations that arise between scaled-solar and the
other cases are examined with respect to the H-R diagram and main sequence

an insulator. In two dimensions (2D) both superconductivity and charge-density
waves (CDW) are believed to be anomalous. In superconducting cuprates, critical
transition temperatures are unusually high and the energy gap may stay unclosed
even above these temperatures (pseudogap). In CDW-bearing dichalcogenides the
resistivity below the transition can decrease with temperature even faster than
in the normal phase and a basic prerequisite for the CDW, the favourable
nesting conditions (when some sections of the Fermi surface appear shifted by
the same vector), seems to be absent. Notwithstanding the existence of
alternatives to conventional theories, both phenomena in 2D still remain the
most fascinating puzzles in condensed matter physics. Using the latest
developments in high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy

reionisation is gravitationally lensed by material at all lower redshifts.
Low-frequency radio observations of this emission can be used to reconstruct
the projected mass distribution of foreground material, both light and dark. We
compare the potential imaging capabilities of such 21-cm lensing with those of
future galaxy lensing surveys. We use the Millennium Simulation to simulate
large-area maps of the lensing convergence with the noise, resolution and
redshift-weighting achievable with a variety of idealised observation
programmes. We find that the signal-to-noise of 21-cm lens maps can far exceed
that of any map made using galaxy lensing. If the irreducible noise limit can
be reached with a sufficiently large radio telescope, the projected convergence
map provides a high-fidelity image of the true matter distribution, allowing
the dark matter halos of individual galaxies to be viewed directly, and giving
a wealth of statistical and morphological information about the relative
distributions of mass and light. For instrumental designs like that planned for

consider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as
the ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the
photometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from
previous studies that the probability increases with the increase of the

perturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost
occurs at moderate magnifications of $A\lesssim 20$, implying that probability
can be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability
increases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of
events associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even
at magnifications as low as $A\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target

This assumption cannot be deduced from the standard postulates of quantum

postulated as a new rule, the {\it quantum typicality rule}. This rule
correlates the positions of the particles at two different times, thus defining
their trajectories. Unexpectedly, this rule is also equivalent to the Born rule
with regard to the explanation of the results of statistical experiments. For
this reason it can be considered a generalization of the Born rule. The
existence of the quantum typicality rule strongly suggests the possibility of a
new trajectory-based formulation of quantum mechanics. According to this new

which corresponds to a canonical stochastic process in which the probability

turbulence of the electron flow may develop at nonadiabatic nanoscale junctions
under appropriate conditions. Here we show that such an effect leads to an
asymmetric current-induced magnetic field on the two sides of an otherwise
symmetric junction. We propose that by measuring the fluxes ensuing from these
fields across two surfaces placed at the two sides of the junction would
provide direct and noninvasive evidence of the transition from laminar to
turbulent electron flow. The flux asymmetry is predicted to first increase,
reach a maximum and then decrease with increasing current, i.e. with increasing

is addressed by analyzing the initial charging transient due to the electron

kinetic models for the expansion is presented, showing that the ergodic model
provides a simplified description, which retains the essential information on
the electron distribution, in particular, the energy spectrum. Results are
presented for a wide range of initial conditions (determined from a single
dimensionless parameter), in excellent agreement with calculations from the
exact Vlasov-Poisson theory, thus providing a complete and detailed
characterization of all the stages of the expansion.

for systems with M500 between 6e13 and 1e15 Msun. Although f_b is lower than
the WMAP value, the shortfall is on the order of both the observational
systematic uncertainties and the depletion of baryons within r500 that is
predicted by simulations. The data therefore provide no compelling evidence for
undetected baryonic components, particularly any that vary in importance with
cluster mass. A unique feature of the current analysis is direct inclusion of
the contribution of intracluster light (ICL) in the baryon budget. The increase
in X-ray gas mass fraction with increasing total mass is entirely accounted for
by a decrease in the total stellar mass fraction, supporting the argument that
the behavior of both the stellar and X-ray gas components is dominated by a
decrease in star formation efficiency in more massive environments. Within just
the stellar component, the fraction of the total stellar luminosity in the BCG
and ICL decreases as velocity dispersion increases, suggesting that the BCG+ICL
component, and in particular the dominant ICL component, grows less efficiently
in higher mass environments. The degree to which this behavior arises from our
sample selection, which favored systems with central, giant elliptical
galaxies, remains unclear. A more robust result is the identification of low
mass groups with large BCG+ICL components, demonstrating that the creation of

tight as possible yet preserving the sweepout. We show:
  Each curve in the tightened sweepout whose length is close to the length of

geodesics.

  As an application, we bound from above, by a negative constant, the rate of
change of the width for a one-parameter family of convex hypersurfaces that
flows by mean curvature. The width is loosely speaking up to a constant the
square of the length of the shortest closed curve needed to ``pull over'' $M$.

we identify and spectroscopically follow-up five candidate structures with

nineteen members each. Surprisingly, all five structures lie in a narrow

arXiv:quant-ph/0702144 by Farhi-Goldstone-Gutmann has inspired a recent flurry
of papers, that propose quantum algorithms for evaluating NAND formulas via
quantum walks over tree graphs. These algorithms use two types of unitary
evolution: oracle and non-oracle. Non-oracle evolutions are independent of the
NAND formula input, whereas oracle evolutions depend on this input. In this
paper we compile (i.e., give explicit SEOs and their associated quantum
circuits for) the oracle and non-oracle evolution operators used in some of
these NAND formula evaluators. We consider here only the case of balanced
binary NAND trees. Our compilation methods are based on the CSD (Cosine Sine
Decomposition), a matrix decomposition from Linear Algebra. The CS
decomposition has been used very successfully in the past to compile
unstructured unitary matrices exactly.

from a relativistic jet. In addition, the radio spectral index of the

synchrotron emission from a nebula surrounding the X-ray source. The radio
luminosity of the counterpart is 3.8 x 10^34 erg/s and the minimum energy
required to power the nebula is ~1 x 10^49 erg. These values are two orders of

in the radiation-dominated shocks that form in the accretion flows. Using a
rigorous eigenfunction expansion method, we obtain a closed-form expression for
the Green's function describing the upscattering of monochromatic radiation
injected into the column. The Green's function is convolved with
bremsstrahlung, cyclotron, and blackbody source terms to calculate the emergent
photon spectrum. We show that energization of photons in the shock naturally
produces an X-ray spectrum with a relatively flat continuum and a high-energy
exponential cutoff. Finally, we demonstrate that our model yields good

pulsar X Per.

0705.2027,Measuring Electric Fields From Surface Contaminants with Neutral Atoms,"  In this paper we demonstrate a technique of utilizing magnetically trapped
neutral Rb-87 atoms to measure the magnitude and direction of stray electric
fields emanating from surface contaminants. We apply an alternating external
electric field that adds to (or subtracts from) the stray field in such a way
as to resonantly drive the trapped atoms into a mechanical dipole oscillation.
The growth rate of the oscillation's amplitude provides information about the
magnitude and sign of the stray field gradient. Using this measurement
technique, we are able to reconstruct the vector electric field produced by
surface contaminants. In addition, we can accurately measure the electric
fields generated from adsorbed atoms purposely placed onto the surface and
account for their systematic effects, which can plague a precision
surface-force measurement. We show that baking the substrate can reduce the
electric fields emanating from adsorbate, and that the mechanism for reduction
is likely surface diffusion, not desorption.

0704.3644,Capacity Gain from Two-Transmitter and Two-Receiver Cooperation,"  Capacity improvement from transmitter and receiver cooperation is
investigated in a two-transmitter, two-receiver network with phase fading and
full channel state information available at all terminals. The transmitters
cooperate by first exchanging messages over an orthogonal transmitter
cooperation channel, then encoding jointly with dirty paper coding. The
receivers cooperate by using Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward over an analogous
orthogonal receiver cooperation channel. To account for the cost of
cooperation, the allocation of network power and bandwidth among the data and
cooperation channels is studied. It is shown that transmitter cooperation
outperforms receiver cooperation and improves capacity over non-cooperative
transmission under most operating conditions when the cooperation channel is
strong. However, a weak cooperation channel limits the transmitter cooperation
rate; in this case receiver cooperation is more advantageous.
Transmitter-and-receiver cooperation offers sizable additional capacity gain
over transmitter-only cooperation at low SNR, whereas at high SNR transmitter
cooperation alone captures most of the cooperative capacity improvement.

0705.3735,Symplectic quasi-states and semi-simplicity of quantum homology,"  We review and streamline our previous results and the results of Y.Ostrover
on the existence of Calabi quasi-morphisms and symplectic quasi-states on
symplectic manifolds with semi-simple quantum homology. As an illustration, we
discuss the case of symplectic toric Fano 4-manifolds. We present also new
results due to D.McDuff: she observed that for the existence of
quasi-morphisms/quasi-states it suffices to assume that the quantum homology
contains a field as a direct summand, and she showed that this weaker condition
holds true for one point blow-ups of non-uniruled symplectic manifolds.

0705.1514,"Searching for Gravitational Radiation from Binary Black Hole MACHOs in
  the Galactic Halo","  The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) is one of a
new generation of detectors of gravitational radiation. The existence of
gravitational radiation was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, however
gravitational waves have not yet been directly observed. One source of
gravitation radiation is binary inspiral. Two compact bodies orbiting each
other, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation.
As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causes
their orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase,
producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO sensitive band. In
this thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for low
mass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way.
Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the Large
Magellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo may
be in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It has
been proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be a
component of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOs
will be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHO
binary composed of two 0.5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO sensitive
band around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency,
sweeping through the sensitive band to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds. By using
evidence from microlensing events and theoretical predictions of the population
an upper limit is placed on the rate of black hole MACHO inspirals in the
galactic halo.

0705.1244,Evolving Symbolic Controllers,"  The idea of symbolic controllers tries to bridge the gap between the top-down
manual design of the controller architecture, as advocated in Brooks'
subsumption architecture, and the bottom-up designer-free approach that is now
standard within the Evolutionary Robotics community. The designer provides a
set of elementary behavior, and evolution is given the goal of assembling them
to solve complex tasks. Two experiments are presented, demonstrating the
efficiency and showing the recursiveness of this approach. In particular, the
sensitivity with respect to the proposed elementary behaviors, and the
robustness w.r.t. generalization of the resulting controllers are studied in
detail.

is studied. When the ring is highly flattened, the increase of B would lead to
a big energy gap between the ground and excited states, and therefore lead to a
strong emission of dipole photons. The photon frequency can be tuned in a wide
range by changing B and/or the shape of the ellipse. The particle density is
found to oscillate from a pattern of distribution to another pattern back and
forth against $B$. This is a new kind of Aharonov-Bohm oscillation originating
from symmetry breaking and is different from the usual oscillation of
persistent current.

solvents can be modeled by means of effective bounded potentials, the simplest
of which being that of penetrable spheres (PSs). In this paper we construct two
simple analytical theories for the structural properties of PS fluids: a
low-temperature (LT) approximation, that can be seen as an extension to PSs of
the well-known solution of the Percus-Yevick (PY) equation for hard spheres,
and a high-temperature (HT) approximation based on the exact asymptotic
behavior in the limit of infinite temperature. Monte Carlo simulations for a
wide range of temperatures and densities are performed to assess the validity
of both theories. It is found that, despite their simplicity, the HT and LT
approximations exhibit a fair agreement with the simulation data within their
respective domains of applicability, so that they complement each other. A
comparison with numerical solutions of the PY and the hypernetted-chain
approximations is also carried out, the latter showing a very good performance,
except inside the core at low temperatures.

0705.0879,Spin transport in magnetic multilayers,"  We study by extensive Monte Carlo simulations the transport of itinerant
spins travelling inside a multilayer composed of three ferromagnetic films
antiferromagnetically coupled to each other in a sandwich structure. The two
exterior films interact with the middle one through non magnetic spacers. The
spin model is the Ising one and the in-plane transport is considered. Various
interactions are taken into account. We show that the current of the itinerant
spins going through this system depends strongly on the magnetic ordering of
the multilayer: at temperatures $T$ below (above) the transition temperature
$T_c$, a strong (weak) current is observed. This results in a strong jump of
the resistance across $T_c$. Moreover, we observe an anomalous variation,
namely a peak, of the spin current in the critical region just above $T_c$. We
show that this peak is due to the formation of domains in the temperature
region between the low-$T$ ordered phase and the true paramagnetic disordered
phase. The existence of such domains is known in the theory of critical
phenomena. The behavior of the resistance obtained here is compared to a recent
experiment. An excellent agreement with our physical interpretation is
observed. We also show and discuss effects of various physical parameters
entering our model such as interaction range, strength of electric and magnetic
fields and magnetic film and non magnetic spacer thicknesses.

0706.0824,Quantum evolution across singularities,"  Attempts to consider evolution across space-time singularities often lead to
quantum systems with time-dependent Hamiltonians developing an isolated
singularity as a function of time. Examples include matrix theory in certain
singular time-dependent backgounds and free quantum fields on the
two-dimensional compactified Milne universe. Due to the presence of the
singularities in the time dependence, the conventional quantum-mechanical
evolution is not well-defined for such systems. We propose a natural way,
mathematically analogous to renormalization in conventional quantum field
theory, to construct unitary quantum evolution across the singularity. We carry
out this procedure explicitly for free fields on the compactified Milne
universe and compare our results with the matching conditions considered in
earlier work (which were based on the covering Minkowski space).

0704.3003,Deformation principle and further geometrization of physics,"  The space-time geometry is considered to be a physical geometry, i.e. a
geometry described completely by the world function. All geometrical concepts
and geometric objects are taken from the proper Euclidean geometry. They are
expressed via the Euclidean world function \sigma_E and declared to be concepts
and objects of any physical geometry, provided the Euclidean world function
\sigma_E is replaced by the world function \sigma of the physical geometry in
question. The set of physical geometries is more powerful, than the set of
Riemannian geometries, and one needs to choose a true space-time geometry. In
general, the physical geometry is multivariant (there are many vectors which
are equivalent to a given vector, but are not equivalent between themselves).
The multivariance admits one to describe quantum effects as geometric effects
and to consider existence of elementary particles as a geometrical problem,
when the possibility of the physical existence of an elementary geometric
object in the form of a physical body is determined by the space-time geometry.
Multivariance admits one to describe discrete and continuous geometries, using
the same technique. A use of physical geometry admits one to realize the
geometrical approach to the quantum theory and to the theory of elementary
particles.

the order of several hundreds, but the forthcoming AGILE, GLAST and Planck

In preparation for these missions it is necessary to identify new samples of
blazars to study their multi-frequency characteristics and statistical
properties. Methods. We compiled a sample of objects with blazar-like
properties via a cross-correlation between large radio (NVSS, ATCAPMN) and X-

there is an optimal set of one-dimensional projections such that the estimator
obtained from these projections is asymptotically as efficient as the maximum

practical applications, we carry out simulation studies of the proposed method
for two instances of network tomography. The first is for traffic demand

0705.1500,Composition of the Pseudoscalar Eta and Eta' Mesons,"  The composition of the eta and eta' mesons has long been a source of
discussion and is of current interest with new experimental results appearing.
We investigate what can be learnt from a number of different processes: V to P
gamma and P to V gamma (V and P are light vector and pseudoscalar mesons
respectively), P to gamma gamma, J/psi,psi' to P gamma, J/psi,psi' to P V, and
chi_{c0,2} to PP. These constrain the eta-eta' mixing angle to a consistent
value, phi approx 42 degrees; we find that the c cbar components are lesssim 5%
in amplitude. We also find that, while the data hint at a small gluonic
component in the eta', the conclusions depend sensitively on unknown form
factors associated with exclusive dynamics. In addition, we predict BR(psi' to
eta' gamma) approx 1 10^{-5} and BR(chi_{c0} to eta eta') approx 2 10^{-5} - 1
10^{-4}. We provide a method to test the mixing using chi_{c2} to eta eta, eta'
eta', and eta eta' modes and make some general observations on chi_{c0,2}
decays. We also survey the semileptonic and hadronic decays of bottom and
charmed mesons and find some modes where the mixing angle can be extracted
cleanly with the current experimental data, some where more data will allow
this, and some where a more detailed knowledge of the different amplitudes is

distributed over 42 dB channel loss and 200 km of optical fibre. We employed
the differential phase shift quantum key distribution (DPS-QKD) protocol
implemented with a 10-GHz clock frequency, and superconducting single photon

rate (a few Hz) and small timing jitter (60 ps full width at half maximum).
These characteristics allowed us to construct a 10-GHz clock QKD system and
thus distribute secure keys over channel loss of 42 dB. In addition, we
achieved a 17 kbit/s secure key rate over 105 km of optical fibre, which is two
orders of magnitude higher than the previous record, and a 12.1 bit/s secure

inequalities give central limit theorems. The proof of the main result employs
Stein's method of normal approximation. A number of examples are worked out,
some of which are new. One of the new results is a CLT for the spectrum of

0704.3398,Almost Product Evaluation of Hankel Determinants,"  An extensive literature exists describing various techniques for the
evaluation of Hankel determinants. The prevailing methods such as Dodgson
condensation, continued fraction expansion, LU decomposition, all produce
product formulas when they are applicable. We mention the classic case of the
Hankel determinants with binomial entries ${3k+2 \choose k}$ and those with
entries ${3k \choose k}$; both of these classes of Hankel determinants have
product form evaluations. The intermediate case, ${3k+1 \choose k}$ has not
been evaluated. There is a good reason for this: these latter determinants do
not have product form evaluations.
  In this paper we evaluate the Hankel determinant of ${3k+1 \choose k}$. The
evaluation is a sum of a small number of products, an almost product.
  The method actually provides more, and as applications, we present the
salient points for the evaluation of a number of other Hankel determinants with
polynomial entries, along with product and almost product form evaluations at
special points.

0704.0767,Ground-based Microlensing Surveys,"  Microlensing is a proven extrasolar planet search method that has already
yielded the detection of four exoplanets. These detections have changed our
understanding of planet formation ``beyond the snowline'' by demonstrating that
Neptune-mass planets with separations of several AU are common. Microlensing is
sensitive to planets that are generally inaccessible to other methods, in
particular cool planets at or beyond the snowline, very low-mass (i.e.
terrestrial) planets, planets orbiting low-mass stars, free-floating planets,
and even planets in external galaxies. Such planets can provide critical
constraints on models of planet formation, and therefore the next generation of
extrasolar planet searches should include an aggressive and well-funded
microlensing component. When combined with the results from other complementary
surveys, next generation microlensing surveys can yield an accurate and
complete census of the frequency and properties of planets, and in particular
low-mass terrestrial planets.

around the pre-main sequence M1 dwarf TWA 7 using the SCUBA camera on the James

around TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micron
flux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)
assuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes
the TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk
reported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk
detected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly
younger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the
disk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the
dust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures
according to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a
model in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures
according to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in

0705.3597,DNA Hash Pooling and its Applications,"  In this paper we describe a new technique for the comparison of populations
of DNA strands. Comparison is vital to the study of ecological systems, at both
the micro and macro scales. Existing methods make use of DNA sequencing and
cloning, which can prove costly and time consuming, even with current
sequencing techniques. Our overall objective is to address questions such as:
(i) (Genome detection) Is a known genome sequence present, at least in part, in
an environmental sample? (ii) (Sequence query) Is a specific fragment sequence
present in a sample? (iii) (Similarity discovery) How similar in terms of
sequence content are two unsequenced samples? We propose a method involving
multiple filtering criteria that result in ""pools"" of DNA of high or very high
purity. Because our method is similar in spirit to hashing in computer science,
we call it DNA hash pooling. To illustrate this method, we describe protocols
using pairs of restriction enzymes. The in silico empirical results we present
reflect a sensitivity to experimental error. Our method will normally be
performed as a filtering step prior to sequencing in order to reduce the amount
of sequencing required (generally by a factor of 10 or more). Even as
sequencing becomes cheaper, an order of magnitude remains important.

improved our knowledge of long-duration gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and X-ray

We show that the entire X-ray observations are in excellent agreement with the
predictions of the `cannonball' model of GRBs and XRFs, which are based on
simple physics and were published long before the launch of SWIFT. Two
mechanisms underlie these predictions: inverse Compton scattering and
synchrotron radiation, generally dominant at early and late times,
respectively. The former mechanism provides a unified description of the
gamma-ray peaks, X-ray flares and even the optical `humps' seen in some
favourable cases; i.e. their very different durations, fluxes and peak-times
are related precisely as predicted. The observed smooth or bumpy fast decay of
the X-ray light curve is correctly described case-by-case, in minute detail.
The `canonical' X-ray plateau, as well as the subsequent gradual steepening of
the afterglow to an asymptotic power-law decay, are as foretold. So are the
chromatic and achromatic properties of the light-curves.

has yielded a broadband spectrum spanning 0.3 to 250 keV. The net exposure
times after screening were: 70 ks per X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) camera,
60.8 ks for the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) PIN, and 17.1 ks for the HXD-GSO. The
hard X-rays are fit by two power-laws of the same slope, absorbed by columns of
1.5 and 7 * 10^{23} cm^{-2} respectively. The spectrum is consistent with
previous suggestions that the power-law components are X-ray emission from the
sub-pc VLBI jet and from Bondi accretion at the core, but it is also consistent
with a partial covering interpretation. The soft band is dominated by thermal
emission from the diffuse plasma and is fit well by a two-temperature VAPEC
model, plus a third power-law component to account for scattered nuclear
emission, jet emission, and emission from X-ray Binaries and other point
sources. Narrow fluorescent emission lines from Fe, Si, S, Ar, Ca and Ni are
detected. The Fe K alpha line width yields a 200 light-day lower limit on the
distance from the black hole to the line-emitting gas. Fe, Ca, and S K-shell
absorption edges are detected. Elemental abundances are constrained via
absorption edge depths and strengths of the fluorescent and diffuse plasma
emission lines. The high metallicity ([Fe/H]=+0.1) of the circumnuclear
material suggests that it could not have originated in the relatively
metal-poor outer halo unless enrichment by local star formation has occurred.

0705.2246,"Old Metal-rich Globular Cluster Populations: Peak Color and Peak
  Metallicity Trends with Mass of Host Spheroids","  We address the problem of the factors contributing to a peak color trend of
old metal-rich globular cluster (MRGC) populations with mass of their hosts,
early-type galaxies and spheroidal subsystems of spiral ones (spheroids). The
color-mass trend is often converted to a metallicity-mass trend under the
assumption that age effects are small or negligible. While direct estimates of
the ages of MRGC populations neither can rule out nor reliably support the
populations' age trend, key data on timing of the formation of spheroids and
other indirect evidence imply it in the sense: the more massive spheroid the
older on average its MRGC population. We show that the contribution of an
allowable age trend of the MRGC populations to their peak color trend can
achieve up to ~50 % or so. In this event the comparable value of the color
trend, ~30 %, is due to alpha-element ratio systematic variations of the order
of Delta[alpha/Fe] ~ 0.1 to 0.2 dex because of a correlation between the
[alpha/Fe] ratios and age. Hence a systematic variation of exactly [Fe/H]
ratios may turn out to be less significant among the contributors, and its
range many times lower, i.e. of the order of Delta[Fe/H] ~ 0.1 or even none,

filament extending (in projection) up to 22 kpc vertically from the disk. Small

counter-rotating) velocities, are also detected. The overall kinematics of the
halo gas is characterized by differential rotation lagging with respect to that
of the disk. The lag, more pronounced at small radii, increases with height
from the plane. There is evidence that a significant fraction of the halo is
due to a galactic fountain. Accretion from intergalactic space may also play a
role in building up the halo and providing low angular momentum material needed
to account for the observed rotation lag. The long HI filament and the

and biochemical networks is of critical importance in biology today. We sought
to develop a mathematical approach to this problem using, as a test case, one
of the most well-studied and clinically important signaling networks in biology
today, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) driven signaling cascade.
More specifically, we suggest a method, augmented sparse reconstruction, for
the identification of links among nodes of ordinary differential equation (ODE)
networks from a small set of trajectories with different initial conditions.
Our method builds a system of representation by using a collection of integrals
of all given trajectories and by attenuating block of terms in the
representation itself. The system of representation is then augmented with
random vectors, and minimization of the 1-norm is used to find sparse
representations for the dynamical interactions of each node. Augmentation by
random vectors is crucial, since sparsity alone is not able to handle the large
error-in-variables in the representation. Augmented sparse reconstruction
allows to consider potentially very large spaces of models and it is able to
detect with high accuracy the few relevant links among nodes, even when
moderate noise is added to the measured trajectories. After showing the
performance of our method on a model of the EGFR protein network, we sketch
briefly the potential future therapeutic applications of this approach.

derive the expected high energy photon spectra from individual GRBs during the

energy emission is dominated by the leptonic component if fraction of shock
energy carried by electrons is not very small (e.g. $\epsilon_e > 10^{-3}$).
For very small values of $\epsilon_e$ the hadronic emission component could be
comparable to or even exceed the leptonic component in the GeV-TeV regime.
However, in this case a much larger energy budget of the fireball is required
to account for the same level of the observed sub-MeV spectrum. The fireballs
are therefore extremely inefficient in radiation. For a canonical fireball bulk
Lorentz factor (e.g. $\Gamma=400$), emissions above $\sim 10$ GeV are
attenuated by two-photon pair production processes. For a fireball with an even
higher Lorentz factor, the cutoff energy is higher, and emissions of 10 TeV -
PeV due to $\pi^0$-decay can also escape from the internal shocks. The flux

each other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of the
daysides of these planets. A key question is whether the atmosphere is able to
transport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will
determine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we
report observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary
systems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a 'map' of

dayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to
a recent claim for another hot Jupiter. Our data indicate that the peak

from the main sequence through the LBV and Wolf-Rayet stages, up to core

0704.3149,Effects of turbulent diffusion on the chemistry of diffuse clouds,"  Aims. We probe the effect of turbulent diffusion on the chemistry at the
interface between a cold neutral medium (CNM) cloudlet and the warm neutral

simulations with chemistry including thermal and chemical diffusion. The
diffusion coefficients are enhanced to account for turbulent diffusion. We
post-process the steady-states of our simulations with a crude model of
radiative transfer to compute line profiles. Results. Turbulent diffusion
spreads out the transition region between the CNM and the WNM. We find that the
CNM slightly expands and heats up: its CH and H$_2$ content decreases due to
the lower density. The change of physical conditions and diffusive transport
increase the H$^+$ content in the CNM which results in increased OH and H$_2$O.
Diffusion transports some CO out of the CNM. It also brings H$_2$ into contact
with the warm gas with enhanced production of CH$^+$, H$_3^+$, OH and H$_2$O at
the interface. O lines are sensitive to the spread of the thermal profile in
the intermediate region between the CNM and the WNM. Enhanced molecular content
at the interface of the cloud broadens the molecular line profiles and helps
exciting transitions of intermediate energy. The relative molecular yield are
found higher for bigger clouds. Conclusions. Turbulent diffusion can be the
source of additional molecular production and should be included in chemical

propose to add to a high power detuned signal-recycling interferometer a local
readout scheme which measures the motion of the arm-cavity front mirror. At low
frequencies this mirror moves together with the arm-cavity end mirror, under
the influence of gravitational waves. This scheme improves the low-frequency
quantum-noise-limited sensitivity of optical-spring interferometers
significantly and can be considered as a incorporation of the optical-bar
scheme into currently planned second-generation interferometers. On the other
hand it can be regarded as an extension of the optical bar scheme. Taking
compact-binary inspiral signals as an example, we illustrate how this scheme
can be used to improve the sensitivity of the planned Advanced LIGO
interferometer, in various scenarios, using a realistic classical-noise budget.

",gr-qc,"Local readout enhancement for detuned signal-recycling interferometers   Motivated by the optical-bar scheme of Braginsky, Gorodetsky and Khalili, we
propose to add to a high power detuned signal-recycling interferometer a local
readout scheme which measures the motion of the arm-cavity front mirror. At low
frequencies this mirror moves together with the arm-cavity end mirror, under
the influence of gravitational waves. This scheme improves the low-frequency
quantum-noise-limited sensitivity of optical-spring interferometers
significantly and can be considered as a incorporation of the optical-bar
scheme into currently planned second-generation interferometers. On the other
hand it can be regarded as an extension of the optical bar scheme. Taking
compact-binary inspiral signals as an example, we illustrate how this scheme
can be used to improve the sensitivity of the planned Advanced LIGO
interferometer, in various scenarios, using a realistic classical-noise budget.
We also discuss how this scheme can be implemented in Advanced LIGO with

equations with defocusing, smooth, nonlinearity. For a super-cubic
nonlinearity, the limiting system is not directly hyperbolic, due to the
presence of vacuum. To overcome this issue, we introduce new unknown functions,
which are defined nonlinearly in terms of the wave function itself. This
approach provides a local version of the modulated energy functional introduced
by Y.Brenier. The system we obtain is hyperbolic symmetric, and the
justification of WKB analysis follows.

0704.2841,"A High-Throughput Cross-Layer Scheme for Distributed Wireless Ad Hoc
  Networks","  In wireless ad hoc networks, distributed nodes can collaboratively form an
antenna array for long-distance communications to achieve high energy
efficiency. In recent work, Ochiai, et al., have shown that such collaborative
beamforming can achieve a statistically nice beampattern with a narrow main
lobe and low sidelobes. However, the process of collaboration introduces
significant delay, since all collaborating nodes need access to the same
information. In this paper, a technique that significantly reduces the
collaboration overhead is proposed. It consists of two phases. In the first
phase, nodes transmit locally in a random access fashion. Collisions, when they
occur, are viewed as linear mixtures of the collided packets. In the second
phase, a set of cooperating nodes acts as a distributed antenna system and
beamform the received analog waveform to one or more faraway destinations. This
step requires multiplication of the received analog waveform by a complex
number, which is independently computed by each cooperating node, and which
enables separation of the collided packets based on their final destination.
The scheme requires that each node has global knowledge of the network
coordinates. The proposed scheme can achieve high throughput, which in certain
cases exceeds one.

chain introduces degree correlations in the conformation network, which in turn
lead to energy landscape correlations. Folding can be interpreted as a biased
random walk on the conformation network. We show that the folding pathways
along energy gradients organize themselves into scale free networks, thus
explaining previous observations made via molecular dynamics simulations. We
also show that these energy landscape correlations are essential for recovering
the observed connectivity exponent, which belongs to a different universality
class than that of random energy models. In addition, we predict that the
exponent and therefore the structure of the folding network fundamentally

structures. In particular we discuss in detail the relative roles of magnetic
pressure and gas pressure (i.e., the value of the plasma-beta), as well as the
dynamical aspects of the fine structures. Special attention is paid to recent
numerical simulations which include a complex magnetic topology, energy balance
(heating and cooling processes), as well as the multidimensional radiative
transfer. Finally, we also show how new ground-based and space observations can
reveal various physical aspects of the fine structures including their
prominence-corona transition regions in relation to the orientation of the
magnetic field.

astro-ph/0609597], and compare eleven interacting dark energy models with
different couplings to the observational $H(z)$ data. However, none of these
models is better than the simplest $\Lambda$CDM model. This implies that either
more exotic couplings are needed in the cosmological models with interaction
between dark energy and dust matter, or {\em there is no interaction at all}.
We consider that this result is disadvantageous to the interacting dark energy

0705.1826,Dynamical non-axisymmetric instabilities in rotating relativistic stars,"  We present new results on dynamical instabilities in rapidly rotating
neutron-stars. In particular, using numerical simulations in full General
Relativity, we analyse the effects that the stellar compactness has on the
threshold for the onset of the dynamical bar-mode instability, as well as on
the appearance of other dynamical instabilities. By using an extrapolation
technique developed and tested in our previous study [1], we explicitly
determine the threshold for a wide range of compactnesses using four sequences
of models of constant baryonic mass comprising a total of 59 stellar models.
Our calculation of the threshold is in good agreement with the Newtonian
prediction and improves the previous post-Newtonian estimates. In addition, we
find that for stars with sufficiently large mass and compactness, the m=3
deformation is the fastest growing one. For all of the models considered, the
non-axisymmetric instability is suppressed on a dynamical timescale with an m=1
deformation dominating the final stages of the instability. These results,
together with those presented in [1], suggest that an m=1 deformation
represents a general and late-time feature of non-axisymmetric dynamical
instabilities both in full General Relativity and in Newtonian gravity.

0705.4605,"Role of chain stiffness on the conformation of single polyelectrolytes
  in salt solutions","  Conformation of single polyelectrolytes in tetravalent salt solutions is
investigated under the framework of a coarse-grained model, using Langevin
dynamics simulations. The chain size, studied by the radius of gyration, shows
three different variational behaviors with salt concentration, depending on the
chain stiffness. According to these behaviors, polyelectrolytes of fixed chain
length are classified into three categories: flexible chain, semiflexible
chain, and rigid chain. The worm-like chain model with persistence length
predicted by the Odijk-Skolnick-Fixman theory is found to be able to
qualitatively describe the end-to-end distance at low salt concentration. In a
low-salt region, a flexible polyelectrolyte extends more significantly than a
semiflexible chain, and in a high-salt region, regardless of chain stiffness, a
chain attains a dimension comparable to that of its neutral polymer. The chain
stiffness influences both the local and the global chain structures. A flexible
chain exhibits a zigzagged local structure in the presence of salt ions and the
condensed structure is a disordered, random globule. A semiflexible chain is
locally smooth, and the condensed structure is orderly packed, taking a form
such as hairpin or toroid. Moreover, the chain stiffness can also affect the
nature of the coil-globule transition. The transition is occurred in a discrete
manner for semiflexible chain, whereas in a continuous way for flexible chain.
This discrete feature is happened not only at low salt concentration when a
semiflexible chain is collapsed, but also at high salt concentration when the
collapsed chain is reexpanded. At the end, the effects of chain stiffness and
salt concentration on the conformation of single polyelectrolytes are

hep-th/0502058 to a first consistency check in string theory. In particular, we
consider whether the expansion of the string effective action is consistent in
the presence of D-branes and O-planes. Due to the no-scale structure at
tree-level, the scenario is surprisingly robust. We compute the modification of
soft supersymmetry breaking terms, and find only subleading corrections. We
also comment that for large-volume limits of toroidal orientifolds and fibered
Calabi-Yau manifolds the corrections can be more important, and we discuss
further checks that need to be performed.

supergravity, and find a solution to the field equations in qualitative
agreement with observation of distant supernovae, primordial nucleosynthesis

carrier of the acceleration in the present de Sitter epoch is a quintessence
field slowly rolling down its exponential potential. Intrinsic to this model is
a second modulus which is automatically stabilized and acts as a source of cold
dark matter with a mass proportional to an exponential function of the
quintessence field (hence realizing VAMP models within a String context).
However, any attempt to saturate the present cold dark matter component in this
manner leads to unacceptable deviations from cosmological data -- a numerical
study reveals that this source can account for up to about 7% of the total cold
dark matter budget. We also show that (1) the model will support a de Sitter
energy in agreement with observation at the expense of a miniscule breaking of
supersymmetry in the compact space; (2) variations in the fine structure
constant are controlled by the stabilized modulus and are negligible; (3)
``fifth''forces are carried by the stabilized modulus and are short range; (4)
the long time behavior of the model in four dimensions is that of a
Robertson-Walker universe with a constant expansion rate (w = -1/3). Finally,

tree-level string amplitudes in the Euclidean version of the 2D black hole (x

presence of a tachyon wall potential and a linear dilaton. The dual CFT
corresponds to the perturbed 2D quantum gravity coupled to c<1 matter (x time),
where the operator that describes the tachyon-like potential can be seen as a
n=2 momentum mode perturbation, while the usual sine-Liouville operator would
correspond to the vortex sector n =1. We show how the sine-Liouville

the symmetries of the theory. After briefly reviewing the computation of

numerical simulations of saturated MRI-driven turbulence in non-stratified
shearing boxes. It relates the turbulent stresses to the strength of the
vertical magnetic field, the sound speed, the vertical size of the box, and the
numerical resolution and predicts accurately the results of 35 numerical
simulations performed for a wide variety of physical conditions. We use our
result to show that the saturated stresses in simulations with zero net
magnetic flux depend linearly on the numerical resolution and would become
negligible if the resolution were set equal to the natural dissipation scale in
astrophysical disks. We conclude that, in order for MRI-driven turbulent
angular momentum transport to be able to account for the large value of the
effective alpha viscosity inferred observationally, the disk must be threaded
by a significant vertical magnetic field and the turbulent magnetic energy must
be in near equipartition with the thermal energy. This result has important

0704.3059,"Finding Solar System Analogs With SIM and HIPPARCOS: A White Paper for

substantially towards longer periods (proportinal to P^2/3), so that
long-period planets can be more easily detected, in principle. For example, a
one Solar-mass (M_Sun) star would be pulled by roughly 1 mas by a one
Jupiter-mass (M_J) planet with a period of one-hundred years at a distance of
20 pc. Such position accuracies can now be obtained with both ground-based and
space-based telescopes. The difficulty was that it often takes many decades
before a detectable position shift will occur. However, by the time the next
generation of astrometric missions such as SIM will be taking data, several
decades will have past since the first astrometric mission, HIPPARCOS. Here we
propose to use a new astrometric method that employs a future, highly accurate
SIM Quick-Look survey and HIPPARCOS data taken twenty years prior. Using
position errors for SIM of 4 muas, this method enables the detection and
characterization of Solar-system analogs (SOSAs) with periods up to 240 (500)
years for 1 (10) M_J companions. Because many tens of thousands nearby stars
can be surveyed this way for a modest expenditure of SIM time and SOSAs may be
quite abundant, we expect to find many hundreds of extra-solar planets with
long-period orbits. Such a data set would nicely complement the short-period
systems found by the radial-velocity method. Brown dwarfs and low-mass stellar
companions can be found and characterized if their periods are shorter than
about 500 years. This data set will provide invaluable constraints on models of

arises a giant Zeeman splitting in the presence of a moderately low magnetic

current-voltage characteristics shows two peaks corresponding to transport for
each spin channel. This behavior is experimentally observed and can be
reproduced with a simple tunneling model. The model thus allows to analyze
other configurations. First, we further increase the magnetic field, which
leads to a spin polarization of the electronic current injected from the leads,
thus giving rise to a relative change in the current amplitude. We demonstrate
that the spin polarization in the emitter can be determined from such a change.
Furthermore, in the case of a magnetically doped injector our model shows a
large increase in peak amplitude and a shift of the resonance to higher
voltages as the external field increases. We find that this effect arises from
a combination of giant Zeeman splitting, 3-D incident distribution and broad

between competing models. Here we explore various methods for computing Bayes
factors in the context of determining which galactic binaries have measurable
frequency evolution. The methods explored include a Reverse Jump Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm, Savage-Dickie density ratios, the Schwarz-Bayes
Information Criterion (BIC), and the Laplace approximation to the model
evidence. We find good agreement between all of the approaches.

0705.1109,"On monotonicity, stability, and construction of central schemes for
  hyperbolic conservation laws with source terms (Revised Version)","  The monotonicity and stability of difference schemes for, in general,
hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with source terms are studied. The
basic approach is to investigate the stability and monotonicity of a non-linear
scheme in terms of its corresponding scheme in variations. Such an approach
leads to application of the stability theory for linear equation systems to
establish stability of the corresponding non-linear scheme. The main
methodological innovation is the theorems establishing the notion that a
non-linear scheme is stable (and monotone) if the corresponding scheme in
variations is stable (and, respectively, monotone). Criteria are developed for
monotonicity and stability of difference schemes associated with the numerical
analysis of systems of partial differential equations. The theorem of
Friedrichs (1954) is generalized to be applicable to variational schemes with
non-symmetric matrices. A new modification of the central Lax-Friedrichs (LxF)
scheme is developed to be of the second order accuracy. A monotone piecewise
cubic interpolation is used in the central schemes to give an accurate
approximation for the model in question. The stability and monotonicity of the
modified scheme are investigated. Some versions of the modified scheme are
tested on several conservation laws, and the scheme is found to be accurate and
robust. As applied to hyperbolic conservation laws with, in general, stiff
source terms, it is constructed a second order scheme based on

no steady waves appear at velocities below the minimum phase velocity $c_{min}

threshold exists for a steady circular motion, for which, even at small

originates from the emission of a spiral-like wave pattern. Our results are in
good agreement with direct experimental observations of the wave pattern
created by a circularly moving needle in contact with water. Our study leads to

Besides, the zeros of the orthogonal and para-orthogonal rational functions are

emission and absorption from this NVII transmission. For absorption studies,
3C273, 3C 279, 3C 345, and 4C+39.25 were observed but no feature were seen
above the 5 sigma level. For emission line studies, we observed Abell 1835,
Abell 2390 and the star-forming galaxy PKS 1345+12, but no features were seen
exceeding 5 sigma. We examine whether the strongest emission feature, in Abell

sigma), might be expected from theoretical models. The emission feature would
require ~1E10 Msolar of 1E6 K gas, which is inconsistent with X-ray limits for

can be extracted in the X-ray energy band ranging from 1 keV up to 200 keV.
Although NGC 2992 shows a complex spectrum below 10 keV, the hard tail observed

flux level during the observation. No cut-off is detectable up to the detection
limit around 200 keV. In addition, NGC 3081 is detected in the INTEGRAL and

In NGC 2992 a constant spectral shape is observed over a hard X-ray luminosity

interface. A complete basis of homogeneous solutions for the interior and
exterior regions, corresponding to all possible Dirichlet boundary values at
the interface, are calculated in a preprocessing step. This basis is used to
construct the influence matrix which serves to transform the coupled boundary
conditions into conditions on the interior problem. Chebyshev approximations

standard Chebyshev spectral method is used to calculate the interior solutions.
The exterior harmonic solutions are calculated as the convolution of the

itself the solution to an integral equation which has an analytic solution when
the boundary values are given as a Chebyshev expansion. Properties of Chebyshev
approximations insure that the basis of exterior harmonic functions represents
the external near-boundary solutions uniformly. The method is tested by
calculating the electrostatic potential resulting from charge distributions in

of the critical Josephson current ($I_C$) and the normal state resistance ($R$)
(the so-called $I_{\rm C}R$ product) is very small compared to the prediction
of the standard theory. We show that the $I_{\rm C}R$ product in D/DN/I/DN/D

dominate at relatively small azimuthal angles as well as for asymmetric
transverse momenta. For correlations of the photon with the leading jet (the
one having the biggest transverse momentum) the NLO approach gives zero
contribution at $\phi_{-} < \pi/2$ which opens a possibility to study

0705.4634,"Selective control of the apoptosis signaling network in heterogeneous
  cell populations","  Selective control in a population is the ability to control a member of the
population while leaving the other members relatively unaffected. The concept
of selective control is developed using cell death or apoptosis in
heterogeneous cell populations as an example. Apoptosis signaling in
heterogeneous cells is described by an ensemble of gene networks with identical
topology but different link strengths. Selective control depends on the
statistics of signaling in the ensemble of networks and we analyse the effects
of superposition, non-linearity and feedback on these statistics. Parallel
pathways promote normal statistics while series pathways promote skew
distributions which in the most extreme cases become log-normal. We also show
that feedback and non-linearity can produce bimodal signaling statistics, as
can discreteness and non-linearity. Two methods for optimizing selective
control are presented. The first is an exhaustive search method and the second
is a linear programming based approach. Though control of a single gene in the
signaling network yields little selectivity, control of a few genes typically
yields higher levels of selectivity. The statistics of gene combinations
susceptible to selective control is studied and is used to identify general
control strategies. We found that selectivity is promoted by acting on the
least sensitive nodes in the case of weak populations, while selective control
of robust populations is optimized through perturbations of more sensitive
nodes. High throughput experiments with heterogeneous cell lines could be
designed in an analogous manner, with the further possibility of incorporating
the selectivity optimization process into a closed-loop control system.

0704.3488,Optimal Occulter Design for Finding Extrasolar Planets,"  One proposed method for finding terrestrial planets around nearby stars is to
use two spacecraft--a telescope and a specially shaped occulter that is
specifically designed to prevent all but a tiny fraction of the starlight from
diffracting into the telescope. As the cost and observing cadence for such a
mission will be driven largely by the separation between the two spacecraft, it
is critically important to design an occulter that can meet the observing goals
while flying as close to the telescope as possible. In this paper, we explore
this tradeoff between separation and occulter diameter. More specifically, we
present a method for designing the shape of the outer edge of an occulter that
is as small as possible and gives a shadow that is deep enough and large enough
for a 4m telescope to survey the habitable zones of many stars for Earth-like
planets. In particular, we show that in order for a 4m telescope to detect in
broadband visible light a planet 0.06 arcseconds from a star shining $10^{10}$

into account that the momenta flowing along the three legs of the diagram are

D--array at 20 cm. High spatial resolution and sensitivity in both total and

considerable extended emission, not only from the main arms I S and I N, but
also from the weaker arms. The large--scale magnetic field exhibits
well--ordered spiral structure with almost the same orientation as that of the
optical spiral arms, however, it does not show a clear structural correlation
or anti--correlation with the optical arms. There is a north-south asymmetry in
polarization that is frequency-dependent. We found that the ring mean spectral
index versus radius increases faster beyond $R$ = 4 kpc. At each wavelength,
the exponential scale length is larger inside than outside $R$ = 4 kpc. From
the larger scales lengths at $R$ $<$ 4 kpc, we conclude that star forming

We then calculate the correlation length r_0 of the real-space two-point
correlation function xi(r) = (r/r_0)^(-1.8) from A_w through the Limber
transformation, assuming a flat, Lambda-dominated universe. Neglecting
contamination, we find r_0 = 3.20 +/- 0.42 Mpc/h. Taking into account a
possible 28% contamination by randomly distributed sources, we find r_0 = 4.61

event. We compare our results with models, complementing them with available
measurements from the literature. We study the afterglow light curve and
spectrum including X-ray data. We also present observations of the host galaxy.
The observed optical emission was likely related to the large flare observed in
the X-ray light curve. The apparent steep decay was therefore not due to the
jet effect. Available data are indeed consistent with low collimation, in turn
implying a large energy release, comparable to that of long GRBs. The flare
properties also constrain the internal shock mechanism, requiring a large
Lorentz factor contrast between the colliding shells. This implies that the
central engine was active at late times, rather than ejecting all shells
simultaneously. The host galaxy has red colors and no ongoing star formation,
consistent with previous findings on this GRB. However, it is not a pure
elliptical, and has some faint spiral structure. GRB 050724 provides the most
compelling case for association between a short burst and a galaxy with old

0705.2496,Galactic dark matter as a bulk effect on the brane,"  The behavior of the angular velocity of a test particle moving in a stable
circular orbit in the vacuum on the brane is considered. In the brane world
scenario, the four dimensional effective Einstein equation acquire extra terms,
called dark radiation and dark pressure, respectively, which arise from the
embedding of the 3-brane in the bulk. A large number of independent
observations have shown that the rotational velocities of test particles
gravitating around galaxies tend, as a function of the distance from the
galactic center, toward constant values. By assuming a constant tangential
velocity, the general solution of the vacuum gravitational field equations on
the brane can be obtained in an exact analytic form. This allows us to obtain
the explicit form of the projections of the bulk Weyl tensor on the brane, and
the equation of state of the dark pressure as a function of the dark radiation.
The physical and geometrical quantities are expressed in terms of
observable/measurable parameters, like the tangential velocity, the baryonic

analytic and numerical approaches, we investigate the time-averaged flow field
around a swimmer. At short distances the swimmer behaves like a pump. At large
distances the velocity field depends on whether the swimming stroke is
invariant under a combined time-reversal and parity transformation. We then
consider two swimmers and find that the interaction between them consists of
two parts; a dead term, independent of the motion of the second swimmer, which
takes the expected dipolar form and a live term resulting from the simultaneous
swimming action of both swimmers which does not. We argue that, in general, the
latter dominates. The swimmer--swimmer interaction is a complicated function of
their relative displacement, orientation and phase, leading to motion that can
be attractive, repulsive or oscillatory.

between a two-level system and the Dirac electron that comes to light when the
two-level system is described within the formalism of second quantization in
terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators. The analogy enables one
to introduce all the powerful tools of relativistic QED (albeit in a greatly
simplified form). The Feynman diagrams and the propagators turn out to be very

close counterpart in the photon scattering off a two level-system leading via
the linear response theory to the general formulas for the atomic

usefulness of these methods, we calculate the polarizability and susceptibility
up to the fourth order of perturbation theory. These {\em ab initio}
calculations resolve some ambiguities concerning the sign prescription and the
optical damping that arise in the phenomenological treatment. We also show that
the methods used to study two-level systems (qubits) can be extended to

photoionization models. The observed absorber belongs to the class of weak MgII
systems on the basis of its equivalent width, however the relative strength of

mentioned absorbers. A rough estimate of the probability to cross such a system
with a QSO line of sight is P~0.03. The presence of rare neutral transitions
suggests that the cloud is shielded by a large amount of neutral hydrogen. A
detailed comparison of the observed column densities with the average

genotype and temporal axes. Our algorithm first distributes, for every member
of the population, a subset of the genotype to each network node, rather than a
subset of the population to each. This genotype distribution is shown to offer
a significant gain in running time. Then, for efficient use of the
computational resources in the network, our algorithm divides the candidate
solutions into pipelined sets and thus the distribution is in the temporal
domain, rather that in the spatial domain. This temporal distribution may lead
to temporal inconsistency in selection and replacement, however our experiments
yield better efficiency in terms of the time to convergence without incurring
significant penalties.

0705.2424,Spin-Hall edge spin polarization in a ballistic 2D electron system,"  Universal properties of spin-Hall effect in ballistic 2D electron systems are
addressed. The net spin polarization across the edge of the conductor is second
order, ~\lambda^2, in spin-orbit coupling constant independent of the form of
the boundary potential, with the contributions of normal and evanescent modes
each being ~ \sqrt{\lambda} but of opposite signs. This general result is
confirmed by the analytical solution for a hard-wall boundary, which also
yields the detailed distribution of the local spin polarization. The latter
shows fast (Friedel) oscillations with the spin-orbit coupling entering via the
period of slow beatings only. Long-wavelength contributions of evanescent and
normal modes exactly cancel each other in the spectral distribution of the
local spin density.

0706.0224,Long-term tidal evolution of short-period planets with companions,"  Of the fourteen transiting extrasolar planetary systems for which radii have
been measured, at least three appear to be considerably larger than theoretical
estimates suggest. It has been proposed by Bodenheimer, Lin & Mardling that
undetected companions acting to excite the orbital eccentricity are responsible
for these oversized planets, as they find new equilibrium radii in response to
being tidally heated. In the case of HD 209458, this hypothesis has been
rejected by some authors because there is no sign of such a companion at the 5
m/s level, and because it is difficult to say conclusively that the
eccentricity is non-zero. Transit timing analysis [...]. Whether or not a
companion is responsible for the large radius of HD 209458b, almost certainly
some short-period systems have companions which force their eccentricities to
nonzero values. This paper is dedicated to quantifying this effect.
  The eccentricity of a short-period planet will only be excited as long as its
(non-resonant) companion's eccentricity is non-zero. Here we show that the
latter decays on a timescale which depends on the structure of the interior
planet, a timescale which is often shorter than the lifetime of the system.
This includes Earth-mass planets in the habitable zones of some stars. We
determine which configurations are capable of sustaining significant
eccentricity for at least the age of the system, and show that these include
systems with companion masses as low as a fraction of an Earth mass. The
orbital parameters of such companions are consistent with recent calculations
which show that the migration process can induce the formation of low mass
planets external to the orbits of hot Jupiters. Systems with inflated planets
are therefore good targets in the search for terrestrial planets.

primordial or collisional binary systems. In the context of dwarf spheroidal
galaxies it is hard to firmly disentangle a genuine BSS population from young
main sequence (MS) stars tracing a ~1-2 Gyr old star forming episode. Assuming
that their blue plume populations are made of BSS, we estimate the BSS
frequency for 8 Local Group non star-forming dwarf galaxies, using a
compilation of ground and space based photometry.
  Our results can be summarized as follows: (i) The BSS frequency in dwarf
galaxies, at any given Mv, is always higher than that in globular clusters of
similar luminosities; (ii) the BSS frequency for the lowest luminosity dwarf
galaxies is in excellent agreement with that observed in the Milky Way halo;
and most interestingly (iii) derive a statistically significant
anti-correlation between the BSS frequency and the galaxy Mv.
  The low density, almost collision-less, environments of our dwarf galaxy
sample allow us to infer (i) their very low dynamical evolution; (ii) a
negligible production of collisional BSS; and consequently (iii) that their
blue plumes are mainly made of primordial binaries. The dwarf galaxies

three-dimensional radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. While the
millimetre continuum at 0.3mm originates mainly from the upper photosphere, the
longer wavelengths considered here map the low and middle chromosphere. The
effective formation height increases generally with wavelength and also from
disk-centre towards the solar limb. The average intensity contribution
functions are usually rather broad and in some cases they are even
double-peaked as there are contributions from hot shock waves and cool
post-shock regions in the model chromosphere. Taking into account the
deviations from ionisation equilibrium for hydrogen gives a less strong
variation of the electron density and with it of the optical depth. The result
is a narrower formation height range. The average brightness temperature
increases with wavelength and towards the limb. The relative contrast depends
on wavelength in the same way as the average intensity but decreases towards
the limb. The dependence of the brightness temperature distribution on
wavelength and disk-position can be explained with the differences in formation
height and the variation of temperature fluctuations with height in the model

locate their target sites through a 1D or 3D pathway is still a matter of
speculation. It has been suggested that the optimum search time is when the
protein equally shares its search time between 1D and 3D diffusions. In this
paper, we study the above problem using a Monte Carlo simulation by considering
a very simple physical model. A 1D strip, representing a DNA, with a number of
low affinity sites, corresponding to non-target sites, and high affinity sites,
corresponding to target sites, is considered and later extended to a 2D strip.
We study the 1D and 3D exploration pathways, and combinations of the two modes

along the strip with no dissociation; a jumper that represents dissociation and
then re-association of a TF with the strip at later time at a distant site; and
a hopper that is similar to the jumper but it dissociates and then
re-associates at a faster rate than the jumper. We analyze the final
probability distribution of molecules for each case and find that TFs can
locate their targets fast enough even if they spend 15% of their search time

gaps in the energy spectrum which allow electron propagation only for spinors
lying along a certain direction. For spins in the opposite direction the waves
are evanescent far away from the Rashba region, which plays the role of the
scattering center. The most interesting case occurs when the magnetic field is
perpendicular to the Rashba field. Then, the spins of the asymptotic
wavefunctions are not eigenfunctions of the Rashba Hamiltonian and the
resulting coupling between spins in the Rashba region gives rise to sudden
changes of the transmission probability when the Fermi energy is swept along
the gap. After briefly examining the energy spectrum and eigenfunctions of a
wire with extended Rashba coupling, we analyze the transmission through a
region of localized Rashba interaction, in which a double interface separates a
region of constant Rashba interaction from wire leads free from spin-orbit
coupling. For energies slightly above the propagation threshold, we find the
ubiquitous occurrence of transmission zeros (antiresonances) which are analyzed
by matching methods in the one-dimensional limit. We find that a a minimal
tight-binding model yields analytical transmission lineshapes of Fano

wire with extended Rashba coupling, we analyze the transmission through a
region of localized Rashba interaction, in which a double interface separates a
region of constant Rashba interaction from wire leads free from spin-orbit
coupling. For energies slightly above the propagation threshold, we find the
ubiquitous occurrence of transmission zeros (antiresonances) which are analyzed
by matching methods in the one-dimensional limit. We find that a a minimal
tight-binding model yields analytical transmission lineshapes of Fano
antiresonance type. More general angular dependences of the external magnetic
field is treated within projected Schroedinger equations with Hamiltonian
matrix elements mixing wavefunction components. Finally, we consider a
realistic quantum wire where the energy subbands are coupled via the Rashba
intersubband coupling term and discuss its effect on the transmission zeros.

0704.0759,Energy conservation and Onsager's conjecture for the Euler equations,"  Onsager conjectured that weak solutions of the Euler equations for
incompressible fluids in 3D conserve energy only if they have a certain minimal
smoothness, (of order of 1/3 fractional derivatives) and that they dissipate
energy if they are rougher. In this paper we prove that energy is conserved for
velocities in the function space $B^{1/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$. We show that this space
is sharp in a natural sense. We phrase the energy spectrum in terms of the
Littlewood-Paley decomposition and show that the energy flux is controlled by
local interactions. This locality is shown to hold also for the helicity flux;
moreover, every weak solution of the Euler equations that belongs to
$B^{2/3}_{3,c(\NN)}$ conserves helicity. In contrast, in two dimensions, the
strong locality of the enstrophy holds only in the ultraviolet range.

where $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3})$. Otherwise,
for $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$

fast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers and
geometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributions
over the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where a

The results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions.
Finally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequence

account respectively for the rotation of the polarisation and the rotation of

(frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0
(non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is
invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the
transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore
the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for
the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks
at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero
magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization
plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the
susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the
peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the

transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore
the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for
the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks
at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero
magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization
plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the
susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the
peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the
couplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings
leads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,
the experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization
for the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with
our TMRG results.

extension, from the very central regions up to the tidal radius. In the present
paper such a data set is used to study the BSS population and its radial
distribution. A total number of 39 bright ($m_{218}\le 19.5$) BSS has been
detected, and they have been found to be highly segregated in the cluster core.
No significant upturn in the BSS frequency has been observed in the outskirts
of NGC 1904, in contrast to other clusters (M 3, 47 Tuc, NGC 6752, M 5) studied
with the same technique. Such evidences, coupled with the large radius of
avoidance estimated for NGC 1904 ($r_{avoid}\sim 30$ core radii), indicate that
the vast majority of the cluster heavy stars (binaries) has already sunk to the

0704.3622,Disordering Transitions and Peak Effect in Polydisperse Particle Systems,"  We show numerically that in a binary system of Yukawa particles, a dispersity
driven disordering transition occurs. In the presence of quenched disorder this
disordering transition coincides with a marked increase in the depinning
threshold, known as a peak effect. We find that the addition of poorly pinned
particles can increase the overall pinning in the sample by increasing the
amount of topological disorder present. If the quenched disorder is strong
enough to create a significant amount of topological disorder in the
monodisperse system, addition of a poorly pinned species generates further
disorder but does not produce a peak in the depinning force. Our results
indicate that for binary mixtures, optimal pinning occurs for topological
defect fraction densities of 0.2 to 0.25. For defect densities below this
range, the system retains orientational order. We determine the effect of the
pinning density, strength, and radius on the depinning peak and find that the

that the ground state is solid everywhere, including at the Rokhsar-Kivelson

amplitude sum of SU(3) singlet triangular plaquettes on the face centered cubic

reminiscent of the lower banana branch in atoll sources. Only one kilohertz QPO
peak is detected at a relatively high frequency of 1258+-2 Hz and at a single

since the radion may turn out to be the lightest particle in such models. We
calculate the coupling of the radion in such scenarios to bulk fermion and
gauge modes. Special attention needs to be devoted to the coupling to massless
gauge fields (photon, gluon), since it is well known that loop effects may be
important for these fields. We also present a detailed explanation of these
couplings from the CFT interpretation. We then use these couplings to determine
the radion branching fractions and discuss some of the discovery potential of
the LHC for the radion. We find that the gamma-gamma signal is enhanced over
most of the range of the radion mass over the gamma-gamma signal of a SM Higgs,
as long as the RS scale is sufficiently low. However, the signal significance
depends strongly on free parameters that characterize the magnitude of bare
brane-localized kinetic terms for the massless gauge fields. In the absence of
such terms, the signal can be be enhanced over the traditional RS1 models
(where all standard model fields are localized on the IR brane), but the signal
can also be reduced compared to RS1 if the brane localized terms are sizeable.
We also show that for larger radion masses, where the gamma-gamma signal is no
longer significant, one can use the usual 4 lepton signal to discover the

three generic regimes of a system response to a slow ramp: (A) mean-field, (B)
non-analytic, and (C) non-adiabatic. In the last regime the limits of the ramp
speed going to zero and the system size going to infinity do not commute and
the adiabatic process does not exist in the thermodynamic limit. We support our

Experimentally, the self-diffusion coefficient of Ni is measured by the

method yields also the interdiffusion coefficient. Whereas the experiments were
done in the normal liquid state, the simulations provided the determination of
both self-diffusion and interdiffusion constants in the undercooled regime as

the temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient is
larger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows that
this difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can be
refered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamic
factor \Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force for
interdiffusion. The simulations also indicate that the Darken equation is a
good approximation, even in the undercooled regime. This implies that dynamic
